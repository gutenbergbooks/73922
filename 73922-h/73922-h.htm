<div>
  <h2 class='c002'>THE COMMON WELFARE</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c003'>SPREAD OF THE SURVEY IDEA</h3>

<p class='c004'>A hundred and more cities in thirty-four states
have asked for surveys or advice in starting local
survey movements. This nation-wide service
sought from the Department of Surveys and
Exhibits of the Russell Sage Foundation, since
its organization last October<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c005'><sup>[1]</sup></a>, shows how thoroughly
the idea has gripped the leaders of social
and civic effort throughout the country. Furthermore,
leading citizens and organizations, who
once looked askance at “exposures” and “muck
raking,” have come to understand the constructive
value of a survey and now take active part
in local efforts in this direction.</p>

<p class='c006'>In many cases requests are backed by local
commercial organizations, chambers of commerce
and boards of trade. Business men are recognizing
the commercial value of making cities
healthier, better and more comfortable to live in.
Cities in Canada and several other foreign countries,
notably India, have also sought information
and advice from the department.</p>

<p class='c006'>Response to these requests has been determined
by several factors—chiefly the timeliness of
the proposed survey and its probable influence on
other cities. As to timeliness consideration is
made of the probability of the project being
adequately financed
and of its receiving
representative local
backing. If a city
cannot see sufficient
value in a survey to be
willing to pay for it
(especially when all
overhead charges are
borne by an outside
organization) it is considered
not ready for a
survey. Moreover, the
undertaking should be
a community enterprise,
aimed to advance the
well being not of any
particular interest or
set of interests, but of
the community as generally
as possible. The
survey is an effort
toward a democratic
solution of local problems,
and therefore must be shouldered by
representatives of all interests and groups in
the population—in other words, by the community
through its representatives. Emphasis
has been laid upon the importance of the work
being done by persons with adequate training and
experience. Emphasis has also been placed upon
the importance of co-operation with national
organizations so that the local program following
the survey, whether it involves housing, organized
charity, prison reform, or other special effort,
will be in harmony with the standards
set up by the national organizations in the various
fields.</p>

<p class='c006'>This method of procedure has tended in some
instances to hold back surveys rather than to
encourage them, and this the department regards
as preferable to undertaking surveys where conditions
are not favorable.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>PATH-FINDER SURVEYING</h3>

<p class='c004'>Two kinds of field work in surveys have been
undertaken—“pathfinder’s surveys” and preliminary
surveys. The former are quick diagnoses
of local conditions pointing to the need of the
longer and more intensive survey. They gather
enough local facts to indicate the main lines of
investigation which
should be taken up
later, the probable
length of time necessary
for the survey, and
the probable cost.</p>

<p>THE SOCIAL SURVEYOR<br>  <br>  <span class='right'><i>Courtesy of the Scranton Tribune-Republican.</i></span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>At the invitation of
the Topeka (Kans.)
Federation of Churches
given through its president,
Rev. Roy B.
Guild, such a pathfinder’s
survey of Topeka
was made in December.
As a result, a
local survey committee
composed of representative
citizens was
formed, and a campaign
started to raise
the funds estimated as
necessary. Twelve
hundred dollars in cash
was contributed within
a few weeks after the
campaign was started.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>The Chairman, Judge T. F. Garver and Secretary,
H. T. Chase have been supported by a
strong favorable public opinion among leading
citizens.</p>

<p class='c006'>Similarly, as a result of the sanitary survey
of Springfield, Ill., made by Dr. George T. Palmer,
local citizens wished such other investigations
made as would in the end mean a general
survey of the city. At their invitation a “pathfinder’s”
survey of Springfield was made by the
department, and a local survey committee headed
by Senator Logan Hay and with A. L. Bowen,
secretary of the State Board of Charities, as
secretary, was organized. The appointment of
a finance committee has been authorized, and
work toward raising the necessary funds is soon
to begin.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another quick diagnosis of city conditions
was made by the department recently for Scranton,
Pa. The project was urged by the Civic
Improvement Committee of the Scranton Century
Club, of which Gertrude Lovell is chairman.
The Century Club became interested and through
its president, Mrs. Ronald P. Gleason, the Department
of Surveys and Exhibits was invited
to make the preliminary examination. The report
presented to an open meeting of the club
covered public health and sanitation, taxation
and public finance, community assets, civic improvement,
education, charity and other betterment
agencies, recreation, delinquency, work conditions
and relations. The findings and recommendations
of this quick diagnosis were given
wide circulation in the city by the newspapers.</p>

<p class='c006'>Among the larger efforts of the department
is a preliminary survey of Newburgh. N. Y.,
which was started March 15. The department’s
field director, Zenas L. Potter, is being assisted
by Franz Schneider, Jr., also of the department’s
staff, in the investigation of public
health; Margaret F. Byington of the Charity
Organization Department of the Russell Sage
Foundation has investigated public and private
charity work; D. O. Decker is covering public
finance and municipal efficiency; E. F. Brown
of the National Child Labor Committee is assisting
in the studies of labor conditions; and
Franklin Zeiger is studying housing. The New
York Consumers League expects also to send
a field worker to co-operate for a fortnight.
Amy Woods, secretary of the Newburgh Associated
Charities, started the movement toward
the Newburgh survey. The project has
had the support of citizens representing the
business-men’s associations, labor unions,
churches, charity and other social organizations,
city administration and women’s organizations.
The findings of this survey are soon
to be ready for publication.</p>

<p class='c006'>The preliminary surveys are designed to attain
three kinds of results. First, they aim
to reveal sufficient local facts to permit the planning
of an intelligent program for community
advance, say for a period of five years. Not only
liabilities but community assets—the forces to
build on and to build with—as well as what to
build will be.</p>

<p class='c006'>Second, the preliminary survey aims to be the
means of enlisting public support for measures
which champion human welfare. The public official
with a vision of what he might accomplish
toward social well being needs the support of
public opinion. His and other work for city progress
are as often hampered by public indifference
as by the selfish interests of an active few.
Public indifference in matters of its own vital
concern disappears quickly when the public is
intelligently informed. City self-knowledge is a
chief effort of the survey.</p>

<p class='c006'>Third, the preliminary survey is to collect
sufficient data to point out the problems which
need more thorough or continuous investigation.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>PROSTITUTION BANISHED IN ONE NEW YORK TOWN</h3>

<p class='c004'>It is an innovation for the physicians of any
community to protest in a body against prostitution
solely on the ground that it is a menace to
public health. Yet this has happened in Norwich,
a village of 8,000 people in Chenango
County, New York.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='right'><cite>Newburgh, N. Y., Journal</cite></span><br>  <br>  “I SEE BY THE PAPERS—”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Several months ago, Dr. Paul B. Brooks of
Norwich, at a meeting of a district branch of
The New York State Medical Society presented
a paper on the Relation of the General Practitioner
to the Prevalence of Veneral Diseases.
In it he declared that the medical profession
possessed information which, if frankly revealed,
would bring about widespread reforms.
Through their inactivity, he said, doctors are
more responsible than any other class of citizens
for the prevalence of veneral diseases. He
asserted that a large percentage of infections of
this class could be traced, directly or indirectly,
to the public prostitute; that prostitution is, in
no sense, a “necessary evil,” and that if “the
people demand it,” then the moral sense of “the
people” is open to criticism. He believed that
the police of any community, large or small,
if given power to drive out prostitutes, would
be able to protect virtuous women.</p>

<p class='c006'>Shortly after this some eight or ten physicians,
assembled for a meeting of the Physician’s
Club of Norwich, fell to comparing notes on
the prevalence of veneral diseases in the community.
The result was startling. Six or seven
houses of prostitution, running openly and apparently
without restriction, were turning out
dozens of men, and even boys of school age,
prepared to spread the scourge among innocent
women, and through them, to generations unborn.
A large number of the inmates of establishments
were known to be actually infected.</p>

<p class='c006'>The situation impressed these physicians as
being so serious that they determined to call a
special meeting of the club and to invite the
town and village authorities to confer with them.
In the meantime they considered the various
possibilities, including intervention by the Board
of Health, medical inspection, etc. In the end
they decided that there was but one feasible
plan—to attempt the elimination of public prostitution
or at least all but such as was clandestinely
practised.</p>

<p class='c006'>They regarded it as their duty to advise, and
demand, if necessary, the removal of the obvious
breeding grounds for disease.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the local authorities met these physicians,
some were skeptical as to the results which
would follow from such an attempt, though
nearly all agreed that the situation was serious
enough to demand vigorous action. The village
attorney, who had openly opposed public prostitution
for many years, after hearing the evidence,
declared: “If the fathers of this town
were to hear the evidence put before us by these
physicians they would mob these place, and discredit
every one of us!” Some of the establishments
had been in operation for twenty years,
and were regarded as fixtures. It was said that
they “made business”—certain it was that many
physicians had found the inmates regular and
remunerative clients, and that all had shared in
the income from treatment of the diseases which
they bred. Some officials feared that public sentiment
would not support radical action and that
the morals of innocent boys and girls would be
injured by having their attention called to conditions
which perhaps had escaped their notice.
On the other hand they found themselves in an
unusual position—they were confronted by practically
all the local physicians, standing shoulder
to shoulder in a demand for drastic action.</p>

<p class='c006'>Finally, these physicians brought the officials
to their way of thinking. They voted unanimously
to clean out the “red light” district, and
proceeded at once and vigorously. In a month
they had closed up every known establishment,
and had rid the town of a number of street
walkers. Greatly to their surprise, they found
that public sentiment strongly approved of their
action. Since then there has been a reduction
of at least 75 per cent in number of the new
cases of venereal infection.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the establishments within the corporation
limits had been closed, there was one house
without the village jurisdiction, which remained
in operation for a short time. During that
period, every new case, so far as is known that
came to a local physician, could be traced to
that establishment. The district attorney collected
evidence, including the testimony of a
young man who had been infected, presented
it to the Grand Jury, and an indictment followed.
A few weeks later, the proprietor committed
suicide. There has been scarcely a new case
since.</p>

<p class='c006'>“This town of ours,” says a local physician
“is just an average town, no better and no worse
than other towns similar in size and environment.
The physicians, likewise, are average
physicians. What we have accomplished can
be accomplished elsewhere, assuming that our
results are worth while.”</p>

<h3 class='c007'>THE DEAD MAN AT MAMARONECK</h3>

<p class='c004'>It took the killing of one man in the prime
of life, a strike sympathizer—a small merchant
and property holder, he was, of Mamaroneck—and
the wounding of half a dozen strikers by
local police and New York detective-agency
men, to bring to public notice in New York not
only the low pay of the Italian “pick and shovel
men” employed in the suburban towns along
the sound, but also the general violation of
New York state laws on jobs done under contract
for the state and various municipalities.</p>

<p class='c006'>By a coincidence, one of the strikers who left
the town hall of Mamaroneck on April 16, after
the Arbitration Bureau of the New York State
Labor Department had brought about a settlement,
made much the same comment as was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>made by the labor representatives before the
Massachusetts Board of Arbitration when the
Lawrence strike was on.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why didn’t they investigate before we had
to strike?” he asked. “Why did we have to
lose our brother to get what we have a right to
anyway?”</p>

<p class='c006'>The grievances which had led, two days before
this settlement, to a fight on a country road
leading front Harrison to Mamaroneck were not
new.</p>

<p class='c006'>Three months ago, wage and other demands
were presented by the day laborers on road and
street work in this section of the state, who had
organized a year ago in the General Laborers’
International Union of America. No response
was made by the contractors. Thereupon
several thousand men throughout the region—which
is the community zone of the New York,
New Haven &#38; Hartford Railway, struck to
enforce these demands. On April 14 a couple
of hundred strikers marched south from Harrison,
doubling their numbers as they went by
calling out, some say by force, the laborers on
the estates they passed.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the outskirts of Mamaroneck they were
stopped by a score of town officials on the
ground that they had no permit to parade. In
the fight that followed, it was rock and fist—with
a final appeal to knives—against club and
gun. One detective had a leg broken and was
otherwise seriously injured. The injuries of
the strikers were bullet wounds. One was killed.
Following the conflict, the sheriff was appealed
to to swear in the detectives as his deputies, as
vengeance for the killing was feared; but he
refused on the ground that that type of men had
proved, here and elsewhere, altogether too
handy with the gun. They had been brought
out from a New York detective office by the
mayor and police of Mamaroneck, when the rumors
of labor trouble in the contract work grew
thick. It apparently had not occurred to the
town officials to spend an equal amount of energy
in finding out what the trouble was about.</p>

<p class='c006'>Road fights are not frequent occurrences in
this region of gardens and express trains and the
alarm spread panic. Isolated households imagined
most anything at the hands of the “dagoes”
who “must be kept down.” There was a call
for volunteer deputies, and citizens responded
eagerly with their hunting arms.</p>

<p class='c006'>The strikers crowded in hundreds to the house
of their dead comrade, but after their first outbreak
they were found to be so peaceably inclined
that all deputies, except the police department’s
aides from New York, were withdrawn,
and the strikers were even given permission
to follow the hearse to the cemetery,
the day after the strike settlement. This cortege
passed through many of the strike centers
at Mamaroneck, Larchmont, New Rochelle, Mt.
Vernon, and other towns in which the laborers’
union claims a membership of 10,000. It
was the occasion for no disorderly effort at
vengeance.</p>

<p class='c006'>The laborers’ demands of three months ago
covered recognition of the union, wage payments
by the week, an eight-hour day, a wage
minimum for pick and shovel men of $2 a day
with revised hour rates for others of the lower
grades of work. The eight-hour demand is essentially
a demand for compliance with the state
law which all the contractors on these public
jobs have been breaking by working a nine hour
day. The inquiry brought out the fact
that the superintendent of the biggest job of
all, the state road, was a brother of an official
of the State Engineers’ Department, which is
charged with the supervision of such work.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>WHAT THE ARBITRATION BOARD HEARING REVEALED</h3>

<p class='c004'>By the agreement reached by strikers and contractors
at the hearing before the Bureau of
Arbitration, the men waived the point of union
recognition. Since present estimates on the contractor’s
work were made before union demands
were presented, the rate of pay for an eight
hour day is to be based on $2 for a nine hour
day until present contracts expire, all new contracts
to be based on $2 for eight hours. Other
terms of the agreement call for the abolition
of the padrone system; the preferential employment
of laborers living in the neighborhood of
any piece of work—in itself a blow at the padrone
system, with its big employment fees and
rake-off from feeding and transporting the
labor gangs;—the abolition of the shack lodging
house and its keeper and the enforcement of
weekly wage payments. The last two are
merely corrections of illegal conditions. This
agreement was unsigned. It is perhaps given
some security by being filed with the bureau,
but there was no one designated to follow up
and enforce any point except those correcting
illegal conditions.</p>

<p class='c006'>However much the unearthing of these illegal
conditions may reflect on the state labor authorities
as a whole, they are not the fault of the
bureau of arbitration, whose representatives settled
the strike largely on terms which call for a
living up to the law in the future.</p>

<p class='c006'>The mediators laid themselves open to criticism,
however, in yielding their places as impartial
questioners of both parties to the controversy,
to a local official who showed open
prejudice for the contractors and a tendency to
browbeat the strikers throughout the hearing.
This official made the original and astonishing
statement that the strikers’ demand for recognition
was illegal as it constituted a conspiracy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>in restraint of trade, and that it would therefore
render the paper on which their demands
were written worthless before the law.</p>

<p class='c006'>One of his taunting questions was: “How can
you demand $2 a day for a man who isn’t worth
seventy-five cents?” The president of the union
made reply. He was an Italian and he spoke
with some heat; perhaps he did not know he was
setting off a human estimate against what an
economist would call the commodity theory of
labor?</p>

<p class='c006'>“Man wort’ seventy-five cent a day?” he
asked. “No man wort’ seventy-five cent, no
man wort’ less than two dolla day. Man got a
wife, man got a child. Everybody wort’ two dolla
day. That the least price will take.</p>

<p class='c006'>“I like the men live more nice. You no like
to live ten in a room. You no like take your
children out of the school to work. You no like
to be out of work five mont’ in the year. Me
figure this pay on basis twelve mont’ to live on
seven mont’ pay. That’s dolla day. Can you
support five, six child on that?</p>

<p class='c006'>“Contractor can pay. On some men he make
four dolla profit; big profit on all de men. The
men they want this two dolla. They no take
less.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Small as this strike was, in several respects
it was remarkable. It is an instance of the
crystalization of unskilled labor into unions and
its spontaneous outbreak—in this instance without
any revolutionary I. W. W. leadership. The
strike was not in an industrial center, but in
a community of homes, and there were people
who looked out of their windows and saw how
the type of hired detective, who usually operates
in out of the way strike regions, shot
into a crowd of strikers without guns, who were
in more senses than one, to be sure, taking the
law into their own hands, but doing so only
long after the authority which the men with
the guns represented had failed to enforce it.</p>

<p class='c006'>But beyond all that, the strike revealed the
dread, the utter misunderstanding, the gap between
the people who live by the sides of the
roads and the men who build them. They
did not know it was a desire for settled employment,
for homes instead of padrone’s
barracks that was arousing these workers.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>SOME NEW STATE LAWS AFFECTING WOMEN’S WORK</h3>

<p class='c004'>Rhode Island was the first state to legislate in
1913 regarding women’s hours of work. The
law had previously failed to provide any protection
for women employed in stores. It had
prohibited more than fifty-six hours’ work in
one week in manufacturing and mechanical establishments,
but it allowed more than ten hours’
work in one day for various causes. The new
law fixes a flat ten-hour day and fifty-four-hour
week for all women employed in any “factory,
manufacturing, mechanical, business or mercantile
establishment.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Several measures were presented to the Legislature
dealing with this subject. The bill as
passed was introduced as a substitute, at the
request of Chief Factory Inspector J. Ellery
Hudson. It was strongly supported at the hearings
before the Legislature by the Consumers’
League of Rhode Island, by the representatives
of the labor unions, women’s clubs, and the
Rhode Island Medical Society. The removal
of the former exceptions in the law is as great
a gain as the reduction of hours and the inclusion
of mercantile houses. The bill marks a
notable advance in Rhode Island.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another important bill recently passed through
effective concerted action was in Delaware,
where no law was ever before enacted to limit
women’s hours of labor. Two years ago the
Consumers’ League of Delaware carried on a
campaign for a ten-hour bill. This measure passed
the Legislature, but was amended almost
beyond recognition in the process, and in the
end it was not signed by the governor. This
year a ten-hour law committee of the Consumers’
League was formed of which Margaret
H. Shearman has been chairman. In spite of
bitter opposition, a bill was carried through, providing
for a ten-hour day and a fifty-five-hour
week. Success followed a campaign of unusual
vigor, conducted for months throughout the
state. The new law includes women employed
in many occupations—“in any mercantile, mechanical
or manufacturing establishment; laundry,
baking or printing establishment; telephone
and telegraph office or exchange.” Women
employed in canning establishments are exempted.
Many other exceptions and amendments
were pressed, but only one concession was
made to secure the passage of the bill. This
allows one working day of twelve hours each
week.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Texas the Legislature proved more compliant
to the powerful lobby which opposed the
passage of the first woman’s labor law in that
state. Cotton-mill owners, raising the familiar
cry that their industry would be ruined, succeeded
in having themselves wholly excluded
from the new act. They may therefore continue
to employ their women workers as long as they
choose, while the only manufacturers prohibited
from employing women more than ten hours in
one day and fifty-four hours in one week are
those engaged in the garment trades!</p>

<p class='c006'>According to the census of 1910 about 4,000
women are employed in the factories in Texas.
Textiles are not separately listed, but it is fair
to surmise that a small minority of the 4,000
women are garment workers covered by the new
law, and that the great majority are employed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>in the cotton mills, without any legal limitation
of hours.</p>

<p class='c006'>Besides garment workers, the new law includes
women employed in any “printing office,
dressmaking or millinery establishment, hotel,
restaurant or theater, telegraph or telephone
office.” Laundry owners are allowed to employ
women eleven hours in twenty-four, provided
that “time and a half” is paid for work done in
excess of ten hours. A comment by the Texas commissioner
of labor on the new law is worth quoting:
“Will not attempt to apologize for the
same,” he writes, “but will admit it is not much.”</p>

<p class='c006'>In New York a new law has been enacted
which is of national as well as state importance.
This measure was unanimously recommended
by the New York State Factory Investigating
Commission after careful investigation. It prohibits
the employment of women at night in
manufacture, between 10 P. M. and 6 A. M. It
brings the Empire State with its 300,000 women
employed in manufacture up to the level of the
fourteen civilized nations of Europe which have
by international treaty abolished the night work
of women in factories.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hitherto only three states, Massachusetts,
Indiana and Nebraska, have enacted in their
statutes the principle of assuring to working
women a fixed period of rest at night—a principle
adopted by England as long ago as 1847
in the first factory legislation.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this country, usage has so blunted our perception
of the effects of work carried on to midnight
or all night, that the establishment of a
legal closing hour is one of the last steps taken
even by progressive states. Yet in Massachusetts
10 P. M. has been the legal closing hour
in factories for almost twenty-five years, and
the great textile trade has flourished with an
even earlier closing hour for women, set by law
at 6 P. M. since 1907.</p>

<p class='c006'>In recommending the enactment of the nightwork
bill, the Factory Investigating Commission
carefully considered the adverse opinion of the
New York Court of Appeals, which five years
ago, in the Williams case, declared unconstitutional
a similar law prohibiting the night work
of women. The commission concluded that two
new circumstances justified the enactment of a
new law and the reargument of the principle at
stake before the highest court of New York—the
only court of last resort which has rendered
a decision on this subject.</p>

<p class='c006'>These two circumstances are, first, the decision
of the Supreme Court of the United States
upholding the Oregon ten-hour law for women,
handed down since the decision in the Williams
case was rendered; and second, the existence
of many “facts of common knowledge” regarding
the physical, moral and economic effects of
night work, facts which were not brought to
the attention of the New York Court of Appeals
when it decided that Katie Mead was not
likely to be injured by working at 10.20 P. M. in
a given occupation.</p>

<p class='c006'>When the new case comes up for argument it
is reasonable to hope that the New York court
will follow the lead of the Supreme Court of
the United States in taking “judicial cognizance”
of those ascertained facts which go far beyond
the single case at bar, and present to the court
the world’s experience as to legislation of this
character.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>CALIFORNIA WOMEN AND THE VICE SITUATION</h3>

<p class='c004'>A red light injunction and abatement bill, not
essentially different from the law now in effect
in Iowa and Nebraska, passed both houses of
the California Legislature with good majorities
and was signed by Governor Hiram W. Johnson
on April 7. The law declares houses of
prostitution and assignation to be nuisances and
holds responsible both the proprietor of the
house and the owner of the building. It enables
any citizen, whether personally damaged
or not, to bring action; and it levies a fine
against the property itself and forbids its use
at any future time for such purpose.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c005'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c006'>The bill has had a somewhat dramatic history.
In 1911 it was introduced at the request
of the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union
by Assemblyman Wyllie, but though favorably
reported from the Public Morals Committee it
was killed by re-reference to the Judiciary Committee
too late to be returned to the floor.</p>

<p class='c006'>The tremendous general awakening since then
on the subject of the social evil and the exposure
in San Francisco of the enormous sums reaped
by organized vice under the Schmitz-Ruef regime,
led to the formation of a society of social
hygiene. The efforts of the United States Department
of Justice to suppress the traffic in
girls led to the establishment of an anti-slavery
society; and the State Board of Health, under
the leadership of Dr. William F. Snow, made
venereal, like other contagious diseases, reportable,
though only by case numbers.</p>

<p class='c006'>Attention has been gradually focussed upon
the question of the desirability of segregation
of vice or “red light” districts which exist in
nearly all the cities of California except Los
Angeles, and in most of the larger towns. San
Francisco is the only city to make an attempt
at systematic regulation and medical examination
and this city has been the object of repeated
criticism on the part of those who do not believe
in the European system of regimentation. It
has also done its part in preparing the public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>mind for a more intelligent discussion of such
measures as the injunction and abatement bill,
the requirement of a health certificate for marriage,
and the several bills limiting the liquor
traffic which were offered in the present Legislature.</p>

<p class='c006'>The bill as passed was sponsored by the
Woman’s Christian Temperance Union and
endorsed by the State Federation of
Women’s Clubs and the California Civic
League, thus rallying to its support the
many thousands of women who were given the
vote by last year’s suffrage amendment. It is
a significant fact that the measure, though approved
by many men, was formally endorsed
only by ministerial bodies. The large property
interests involved and the subterranean coercion
of liquor and certain real estate interests, made
it impossible to obtain the formal support of
commercial organizations.</p>

<p class='c006'>The campaign on behalf of the measure was,
therefore, necessarily a woman’s movement. The
Woman’s Christian Temperance Union which, as
Franklin Hichborn has pointed out, has “the
largest single block of votes in the state,” educated
their own membership and their men
folk. The California Civic League—chiefly composed
of those who had been active in the suffrage
campaign and whose motto is “study and
service”—undertook the systematic work of educating
the public on the general subject of the
social evil. For four successive months it published
syllabi to be studied by its three thousand
members in thirty centers. Beginning in January,
the union carried on a publicity campaign
in the newspapers and during the last two
months kept several women speakers in the field
talking on the “red light” bill before church
congregations, mass meetings, conferences and
clubs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The California Legislature met for the first
time under the new law of a divided session,
bills being received in January, a recess taken
in February, and measures then being discussed
and voted upon. During the recess most of the
legislators were invited to speak at mass meetings
in their own district and to put themselves
on record on this particular bill. It soon became
known that the delegations from San Francisco
and from Alameda County were, with the exception
of a very few men, against the bill,
while the members of the delegation from southern
California were almost unanimously for it.</p>

<p class='c006'>A picturesque episode of the campaign lay in
the selection of Edwin D. Grant of San Francisco
to introduce the bill in the senate, for
Senator Grant is the successor of a well-known
politician, Eddie Wolf, who had misrepresented
San Francisco for sixteen years in the Legislature.
The replacing of Wolf by Grant was one
of the first political results of woman suffrage
in the city. Although young and relatively inexperienced,
Mr. Grant stood the ridicule of the
reactionary press that constantly heckled him
as “the boy reformer” and, with the support of
older men on the floor, got his bill through
without any weakening amendments.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>DEBATE BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE</h3>

<p class='c004'>The debates in both houses over this bill
brought clearly into view the high political and
social ideals of the younger and more recently
elected members of the Legislature; and it proved
that the women of California, though wholly
inexperienced in politics, knew what they wanted
and would stand solidly for it. They won,
not by lobbying, but by systematic education of
the constituencies of the legislators. It is reported
that one legislator asked a doubtful colleague
if he intended to vote for the bill and
the other replied: “Don’t I have to go home?”
The floor leader of the senate complained publicly
of the “threats” of his constituents who
had urged him to vote for the bill and said that
they would remember their enemies as well as
their friends. Assemblyman Nelson, chairman
of the Assembly Public Morals Committee, said
that he received 1,800 letters on this subject
during the recess.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although the debate in the assembly was sickening
at times, in its revelation of the attitude
of certain men toward the whole matter of
vice, the measure passed by a vote of 62 to 17.
In the senate a strong effort was made by Senator
Beban of San Francisco to sidetrack it by
substituting an investigation into the relation of
women’s wages and vice. But the senate refused
to postpone the injunction bill until this special
committee should report, and in spite of a five-hour
debate, chiefly carried on by those who were
trying to explain plausibly why they were going
to vote against it, the measure passed by a
vote of 29 to 11. Thus, out of a legislature of
120 members, only 28 voted against the bill and
of these a majority were from San Francisco
and from Alameda County.</p>

<p class='c006'>After the bill had passed, a final dramatic
touch was given by the demand of certain so-called
“real estate” interests in San Francisco
for a hearing before the governor. The governor
announced a public hearing to which came
about forty persons, both men and women, representing
all the more important protective, civic
and moral associations of northern California. The
opponents, who perhaps had hoped to get
a private hearing, did not appear; whereupon
the governor signed the bill.</p>

<p class='c006'>Meanwhile, even before the bill was signed,
money had been raised and tentative plans made
for taking care of the women and girls who
should be thrown out of the segregated districts.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>These plans are now being extended to cover
the whole state. It is expected that the companion
measure, a state training home for girls
which carries an appropriation of $200,000, will
also pass and this will ultimately provide for
minors and those who go through the probation
courts. As fast as the injunction measure is
enforced the women’s organizations intend to
offer a home, medical attendance and employment,
if possible, to all refugees who will accept
them.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>CALIFORNIA WOMEN RECALL A JUDGE</h3>

<p class='c004'>The first recall of a judge under California’s
new law took place on April 22 and was accomplished
by the women voters of San Francisco. When
a police magistrate, C. L. Weller, reduced
the bail set by another police judge in the case
of a prisoner accused of attacking a young girl, and
the prisoner at once fled when released on
bail, the women of the city secured 10,000 names
to petition for recall. In the recall election
Judge Weller was opposed by Wiley F. Crist,
who is said to be an enthusiastic young lawyer
of strong reform tendencies. Mr. Crist won
by a margin of only a few hundred votes in a
total of 61,000.</p>

<h3 class='c007'>ORGANIZING TO FIGHT CANCER</h3>

<p class='c004'>For some time medical associations have put
on record their conviction of the need of systematic
work for the prevention of cancer, by
the appointment, at congresses and conventions,
of committees charged to work upon this subject.
These many local efforts came to a head on April
22, when at a meeting in New York under the
chairmanship of Dr. Clement Cleveland, the first
steps were taken toward the formation of National
Anti-Cancer Association.</p>

<p class='c006'>The need and practicability of work for cancer
prevention was pointed out by Dr. LeRoy
Broun, chairman of a committee of the American
Gynecological Society. Dr. Broun also gave
practical suggestions for work among work
women, who are the most frequent victims of
cancer.</p>

<p class='c006'>The work of the new association will be along
the lines followed by the National Association
for the Prevention of Tuberculosis, whose
methods were described at this meeting by its
secretary, Livingston Farrand. This will include
magazine articles—the <cite>Delineator</cite> has indeed already
gone into this field—leaflets, instruction by
nurses, and lectures before womens clubs and
other associations.</p>

<p class='c006'>A committee of organization, consisting of
Leroy Broun, James Speyer, V. Everit Macy,
George C. Clark and Frederick L. Hoffman was
appointed to report to the Congress of Physicians
to be held at Washington next month.</p>

<p class='c006'>A method of teaching arithmetic was in vogue
some years ago by which the answer to each
problem was printed in the back of the book.
Sometimes a problem was stated wrongly or the
answer given was incorrect. Of course, that
complicated matters. I believe they teach arithmetic
differently now.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mildred worked unceasingly at her problem.
She worked at it quite cheerfully as she set out
briskly in the morning for her two mile walk
from her home to the shop where she was employed
as a cash girl. She worked at it wearily
as she crept home on tired swollen feet, when
every automobile as it whizzed past her seemed
to scream “cash!” with its shrill siren.</p>

<p class='c006'>The problem dealt with figures so small it
would seem a child in the third grade could solve
it. Mildred knew it to be so difficult that no professor
of mathematics could have brought her
nearer the answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>This was the problem, though Mildred did not
state it in quite the same way. Let <i>x</i> equal $3.50,
her earnings. From <i>x</i>, plus the very small and
uncertain earnings of her mother, take food for
five plus rent and leave enough for a neat black
dress. She had multiplied the earnings by many
weeks but she had to multiply the food and rent
by an equal number and the answer never came
right.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sometimes, just to keep up her spirits, she
would pretend she had solved it—then what a
pleasant array of problems presented themselves!
The black dress meant a clerk’s position and
added salary. With that as a beginning one
might figure up to a buyer’s position. Somewhere
between lay the possibilities of some
problems like this:</p>

<p class='c006'>Let <i>x</i> equal Mildred’s salary: <i>x</i> minus rent,
minus food, minus clothes equals <i>y</i>, which is
enough left over to permit the tired mother to
hire a woman for the washing.</p>

<p class='c006'>One must be half starved and insufficiently
clad to realize the magnitude of that problem,
rightly solved. The storms of early spring in
New York solve many problems by eliminating
the mathematician. In Mildred’s case they only
postponed the solving.</p>

<p class='c006'>Shoes have no hopes nor dreams, nor even
problems, to keep them from wearing out in
miles of daily walking over cobblestones, and
miles of walking back and forth in the store. Mildred’s
shoes developed gaps and fissures, and
were useless to keep out the wet. Rent was due.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>There was no money to be spared even for carfare.

<p class='c006'>The United States Steel Corporation, in the
annual meeting of its stockholders, held in Hoboken,
N. J., April 21, took a step which may
tend to cause a reaction among that part of the
public which had come to believe, on account of
the frequent pronouncements by the corporation
of its kindly intent toward its employes, that it
would take any reasonable and logical step that
it might to improve labor conditions.</p>

<p class='c006'>To make this clear it is not necessary to go
back to the addresses in this vein that have been
delivered from time to time by executive officers
of the corporation before the American Iron
and Steel Institute and elsewhere. It is
sufficient to refer to the committee of stockholders,
appointed by Judge Gary in the fall of
1911, who made a report on labor conditions to
the stockholders meeting of 1912. Their report
declared that 25¾ per cent of the employes of
the corporation were working twelve hours a day. This
figure included all employes in mines
and quarries, as well as in mills and furnaces.
The committee made it clear that “this schedule
of work was found in the largest proportion in
its departments which are more or less continuous,
such as rolling mills, open hearths, and
blast furnaces, where the percentage of work
for the twelve hours varies from 50 to 60.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Speaking of the effects of the twelve-hour day,
the committee said:</p>

<p class='c012'>“We are of the opinion that a twelve-hour
day of labor, followed continuously by any
group of men for any considerable number
of years means a decreasing of the efficiency
and lessening of the vigor and virility
of such men.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The question should be considered from
a social as well as a physical point of view.
When it is remembered that the twelve hours
a day to the man in the mills means approximately
thirteen hours away from his home
and family—not for one day, but for all
working days—it leaves but scant time for
self improvement, for companionship with
his family, for recreation and leisure. It
is important that any industry be considered
in its relation to the home life of those engaged
in it, as to whether it tends to weaken
or strengthen the normalness and stability
of family life. By a reasonable conserving
of the strength of the working population
of today may we be best assured of a
healthy, intelligent, productive citizenship in
the future....</p>

<p class='c012'>“That steps should be taken now that
shall have for their purpose and end a reasonable
and just arrangement to all concerned,
of the problems involved in this
question—<i>that of reducing the long hours
of labor</i>—we would respectfully recommend to
the intelligent and thoughtful consideration
of the proper officers of the Corporation.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As a result of this recommendation, the finance
committee of the Corporation appointed a subcommittee
of its members, “to consider what,
if any, arrangement with a view to reducing
the twelve-hour day, in so far as it now exists
among the employes of the subsidiary companies,
is reasonable, just and practicable.”
Their findings are published in the annual
report of the corporation for the year
1912, which has recently been issued. The committee
calls attention to the fact that the stockholders’
committee found that “only about 25
per cent of the total number of employes” were
working twelve hours a day. This, in spite of
the fact that the committee distinctly reported
that 50 to 60 per cent of actual steel workers were
twelve-hour men. But as to relieving the situation,
the report reads “it is believed that unless
competing iron and steel manufacturers will also
enforce a less than twelve-hour day, the effort
to reduce the twelve hours per day at all our
works will result in losing a large number of our
employes, many of them preferring to take positions
requiring more hours of work per day.”</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>The report then points out that a considerable
number of men during the past year have left
the employ of the Steel Corporation because they
have enforced the six day week, and have gone
to the employ of other companies where they
could work seven days, and expresses the fear
that the same thing would happen if an eight-hour
day were adopted by the corporation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Of course, nothing is said in this report, nor
was anything said at the stockholders’ meeting
of April 21, as to the real reason why workers
leave their positions when hours of labor are
shortened. The inference to be drawn from the
report is that steel workers are so consumed
with a passion for work that they do not desire
to leave it, even for one day in seven.</p>

<p class='c006'>The facts are that the cost of this reform
was borne by the men. The Steel Corporation
did not pay its men their old earnings
for their new six day stint. It would be
interesting to know the actual wages received
by the larger proportion of those who left the
employ of the Corporation in order that they
might work seven days a week for other companies.
We should then be able to draw our
own conclusions as to whether it was a passion
for work or a desire to support their families
in decency and comfort that led them to look
elsewhere for work when their earnings were
reduced by one-seventh.</p>

<p class='c006'>But the Steel Corporation found itself, according
to its own testimony, in a quandary. A
committee of its own stockholders had recommended
an abolition of the twelve-hour day.
The finance committee had considered the matter
carefully and reported back that because its competitors
had not changed from the twelve-hour
day, they could not. It was a practical difficulty
and they intimated that they were unable to
solve it. It was to cut this Gordian knot that
Charles M. Cabot, the Boston stockholder who
was responsible for the investigation conducted
last year by the stockholders’ committee headed
by Stuyvesant Fish, went to the meeting on
April 21 with this resolution:</p>

<p class='c012'>“Voted, that in view of the Finance Committee’s
report that the change from the
twelve to the eight-hour day in continuous
twenty-four hour processes in our mills and
plants is impracticable unless similar action
is taken by our competitors; and, further,
in view of the fruitful results which followed
the appointment by the American Iron
and Steel Institute at the instigation of officers
of our Corporation of a committee
on seven-day labor, which action has led to
the very general establishment of the six day
week in the steel industry of the United
States; that the stockholders request the directors
to enlist the co-operation of the steel
manufacturers of the United States in establishing
the eight-hour day in continuous
twenty-four hour processes.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The purpose of this resolution was to provide
the quickest, most efficient manner of solving
the dilemma in which the Corporation found
itself, and to provide a way whereby there could
be restored to the workers such a working schedule,
as would not sap their vitality or prevent
them from having what the stockholders’ committee
thought was necessary time for relaxation
and for association with their families. That
this resolution was tabled with the consent of
the officials of the Corporation, will undoubtedly
be interpreted by many as an indication that the
Corporation was not sincere in its plea that its
hands were tied in trying to meet the demand
of the Fish committee for a reduction in hours.</p>

<p class='c006'>Yet Mr. Cabot performed in offering this resolution
possibly his greatest service since he began
his campaign to improve the labor conditions
in the steel industry even though it was an
achievement that he did not have in mind. He
forced the Corporation to show its hand; he
gave it an opportunity to prove whether or not
it really desired, as it was on record as desiring,
a fundamental reform. The Corporation gave
him an unmistakable answer.</p>

<p class='c006'>It would have been better if they had not forgotten
the wise counsel of William B. Dickson,
their former vice-president, when he said, in a
speech advocating one day of rest in seven, that
if the steel companies themselves did not institute
this reform, they would be compelled by
law to institute it, and that the law would be far
more drastic than the manufacturers of steel
would find comfortable.</p>

<p class='c012'>[<i>Mr. Hine’s photographs and the equally vivid impressions he sets down in
the text, tell a story of child labor along the South Atlantic and the Gulf. In an especial
sense these are conditions which public opinion can bring to the door of the
Democratic Party to remedy. For in these states that party is dominant, as it
is in the nation.</i></p>

<p class='c012'><i>First lies the channel of state action, which has thus far been laggard, and
has been obstructed by the child employing interests of the South. At the present
time, a child labor bill which would reach this shore work, is pending in Florida. In
Mississippi shucking is prohibited but there is no enforcing agency and the work
is going on as before.</i></p>

<p class='c012'><i>If the channel of state action fails, child labor reformers point to such national
legislation as would prohibit interstate commerce in canned oysters and shrimps
which are so humanly costly. The recent decision of the United Stores Supreme
Court in the white slave case would seem to indicate that legislation could be drafted
which would hold in the courts, and several bills along the lines of the much controverted
Beveridge bill of 1907 are now before Congress.</i></p>

<p class='c012'><i>It is for the Democratic Party in state and nation to proceed through one
channel or the other.</i>—Ed.]</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>When we speak of child labor in oyster
canning, we refer to the cooked or
“cove” oysters, not to the raw ones.
Children are not used in opening raw oysters
for the sole reason that their fingers are not
strong enough. Occasionally one finds young
boys at work on the boats dredging for the
oysters, but not many children work on the
boats, for that is a man’s job.</p>

<p class='c006'>The two chief sections engaged in the work
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>of canning oysters and shrimps are the Gulf
Coast, from New Orleans eastward to Florida,
and the Atlantic Coast of Maryland, the Carolinas,
and Georgia. Maryland was the pioneer
state, but it has already been outstripped by
Mississippi, and several other states follow close
in amount of annual output.</p>

<p>WORKING UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYE OF THE BOSS</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Every year about October, hundreds of Polish
and Bohemian people (some authorities say
thousands) are herded together by various
bosses or “padrones” in Baltimore and other
centers of the South shipped over to the coasts
by train and by boat and set up in shacks provided
by the canning companies. We are told
by one of the canners, “We give these people
all the modern conveniences.” The modern conveniences
appear to be summed up in artesian
wells. If there were no cold or wet weather in
these parts, if waste and sewage were carried
off, and if there were no crowding, these temporary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>quarters would be endurable; but in cold, or
hot, or wet weather they are positively dangerous,
especially to children. One row of dilapidated
shacks that I found in South Carolina
housed fifty workers in a single room house.
One room sheltered eight persons, and the shacks
were located on an old shell pile within a few
rods of the factory, a few feet from the tidal
marsh where odors, mosquitoes, and sand flies
made life intolerable, especially in hot weather.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is a prevailing impression that in the
matter of child labor the emphasis on the labor
must be very slight, but let me tell you right
here that these processes involve work, hard
work, deadening in its monotony, exhausting
physically, irregular, the workers’ only joy
the closing hour. We might even say of these
children that they are condemned to work.</p>

<p>THREE-YEAR-OLD ALMA WHOSE MOTHER IS “LEARNIN’ HER THE TRADE”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Come out with me to one of these canneries
at three o’clock some morning. Here is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>crude shed-like building, with a long dock at
which the oyster boats unload their cargoes.
Near the dock is the ever present shell pile, a
monument of mute testimony to the patient toil
of little fingers. It is cold, damp, dark. The
whistle blew some time ago, and the young
workers slipped into their meager garments,
snatched a bite to eat and hurried to the shucking
shed. The padrone told me “Ef dey don’t
git up, I go and <i>git ’em up</i>.” See those little
ones over there stumbling through the dark over
the shell piles, munching a piece of bread, and
rubbing their heavy eyes. Boys and girls, six
seven and eight years of age, take their places
with the adults and work all day.</p>

<p class='c006'>The cars are ready for them with their loads
of dirty, rough clusters of shells, and as these
shells accumulate under foot in irregular piles,
they soon make the mere matter of standing one
of physical strain. Notice the uncertain footing,
and the dilapidated foot-wear of that little
girl, and opposite is one with cloth fingers to
protect herself from the jagged shells—they call
them “finger-stalls.” Their fingers are often
sore in spite of this precaution.</p>

<p class='c006'>When they are picking shrimps, their fingers
and even their shoes are attacked by a corrosive
substance in the shrimp that is strong enough
to eat the tin cans into which they are put. The
day’s work on shrimp is much shorter than on
oysters as the fingers of the worker give out in
spite of the fact that they are compelled to
harden them in an alum solution at the end of
the day. Moreover, the shrimp are packed in
ice, and a few hours handling of these icy
things is dangerous for any child. Then, too,
the mornings, and many of the days, are cold,
foggy and damp.</p>

<p class='c006'>The workers are thinly clad, but, like the
fabled ostrich, cover their heads and imagine
they are warm. If a child is sick, it gets a
vacation, and wanders around to kill time.</p>

<p class='c006'>The youngest of all shift for themselves at
a very early age. One father told me that they
brought their baby, two months old, down to
the shucking shed at four o’clock every morning
and kept it there all day. Another told me
that they locked a baby of six months in the
shack when they went away in the morning,
and left it until noon, then left it alone again
all the afternoon. A baby carriage with its
occupant half smothered under piles of blankets
is a common sight. Snuggled up against a steam
box you find many a youngster asleep on a cold
morning. As soon as they can toddle, they hang
around the older members of the family, something
of a nuisance, of course, and very early
they learn to amuse themselves. For hours at a
time, they play with the dirty shells, imitating
the work of the grown-ups. They toddle around
the shed, and out on to the docks at the risk of
their lives.</p>

<p class='c006'>A little older and they learn to “tend the
baby.” As a substitute for real recreation, this
baby tending is pathetic.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mary said, “I shucks six pots if I don’t got
the baby; two pots if I got him.”</p>

<p class='c006'>As soon as they can handle the oysters and
shrimps, they are “allowed to help.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The mother often says, “Sure. I’m learnin’
her de trade,” and you see many youngsters
beginning to help at a very early age. Standing
on a box in order to reach the table, little
Olga, five years old, was picking shrimps for
her mother at the cannery I visited. Later in
the day, I found her at home worn out with
the work she had been doing, but the mother
complained that Olga was “ugly.” Little sympathy
they get when they most need it! Four-year-old
Mary was working irregularly through
the day shucking about two pots of oysters. The
mother is the fastest shucker in the place, and
the boss said,</p>

<p class='c006'>“Mary will work <i>steady</i> next year.” The most
excitement that many of them get from one
month to another is that of being dressed up in
their Sunday best to spend the day seeing the
sights of the settlement.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now we all know that the amount of work
these little ones can do is not much, and yet
I have been surprised and horrified at the number
of hours a day a six or a seven year old
will stay at work, and this with the willing and
eager consent of the parents. “Freckled Bill,”
a bright lad of five years, told me that he worked,
and his mother added reproachfully,</p>

<p class='c006'>“He kin make fifteen cents any day he wants
to work, but he won’t do it steady.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Annie, seven years old, is a steady worker.
The mother said, for her benefit, of course, “She
kin beat me shuckin’, an’ she’s mighty good at
housework too, but I mustn’t praise her too
much right before her.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This is only one of the means used to keep the
children at work. Another method is to tell
the neighbors that Annie can shuck eight pots
a day. Then some other child beats the record,
and so the interest is kept up, and incidentally
the work is done and the family income
enlarged. Can we call that motherhood?
Compared with real maternity, it is a distorted
perversion, a travesty. The baby at Ellis Island
little dreams what is in store for him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Hundreds of these children from four to
twelve years of age are regularly employed,
often as helpers, for the greater part of the
six months if it is a good season. At three
and four years of age they play around and
help a little, “learnin’ de trade.” At five and
six years of age they work more regularly, and
at seven and eight years, they put in long
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>hours every working day. This is the regular
program for these children day after day, week
after week for the six months of their alleged—“outing
down South.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I remarked to one of the village people, “It’s
a wonder that these youngsters live through it
all.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Yes,” she replied, “and when they <i>don’t</i> live
through it, there is a corner over in a little
cemetery waiting for them, and <i>many of them
go there</i>.”</p>

<p class='c006'>You see, “They’re only Hickeys.”</p>

<p class='c006'>I suppose the cemetery is one of the “conveniences”
that the company does not boast
about.</p>

<p>CHILDREN OF THE OYSTER CANNERIES<br>  <br>  A young girl who has been shucking six years and earns a dollar a day; a little mother who alternates baby tending and oyster shucking; a ten-year-old worker has no time for school.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The wages of these workers vary according
to their locality, and the kind of season they
find. The work on the shrimp is better paid
than oyster shucking, but it is much more irregular.
On the latter families frequently earn
ten and fifteen or twenty dollars a week so
when there are several children, and the work
is steady, there is a great temptation to make
them all help. Children of seven years earn
about twenty-five cents a day, and at eight and
ten years of age often fifty cents a day or
more. At twelve and fourteen years they frequently
earn as high as a dollar a day and this is adult
pay. The fastest adult shucker seldom earns much
more than a dollar a day after years of experience.
What then is the outlook for children
beginning this industry?</p>

<p class='c006'>“What is your name, little girl?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dunno.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How old are you?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dunno.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“How many pots do you shuck in a day?”</p>

<p class='c006'>“Dunno.”</p>

<p class='c006'>And the pity of it is that <i>they do not know</i>.</p>

<p class='c006'>What then do they know? Enough to stand
patiently with the rest picking up one hard,
dirty cluster of shells, deftly prying them open,
dropping the meat into the pot; and then go
through this process with another and another
and another, until after many minutes the pot
is full—a relief, for they carry it over to the
weigher and rest doing nothing a minute, and
walk back,—such a change from the dreary
standing, reaching, prying and dropping—minute
upon minute, hour upon hour, day upon day,
month after month. Or perchance, for variety,
the catch may have been shrimp, and then the
hours of work are shorter, but the shrimp are
icy cold, and the blood in one’s fingers congeals,
and the fingers become so sore that she
welcomes the oysters again.</p>

<p class='c006'>Are you surprised then to find that many children
seem dumb and can not understand our
language?</p>

<p class='c006'>“But we educate them” some canners tell us.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is the way they do it. In the few places
where I found any pretense to education the
children shucked oysters for four hours before
school. Then they went to school for half a
day, returning at one o’clock for a hurried lunch.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>They worked for four hours more, five days in
the week. On Saturday they put in an alleged
half day consisting of eight or nine hours work.
Is it any marvel that the school principal told
me “It isn’t satisfactory, but at least we are
giving them some help in learning the language.”
They need the help. At another place,
with two canneries, but two children were going
to school, and the illiteracy of both adults and
children was appalling.</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is no compulsion about schooling
here,” the principal said.</p>

<p class='c006'>The “vocational guidance” which most of them
receive, year in and year out, is seen in the
sheds where under the eagle eye of the boss,
who watches to see that they do not shirk, and
under the pressure of parental authority, they
put in their time where it will bring tangible
returns. One padrone told me:</p>

<p class='c006'>“I keep ’em a-working all the year. In the
winter, bring ’em down here to the gulf. In
Summer, take ’em to the berry fields of Maryland
and Delaware. They don’t lose many
weeks’ time, but I have a hard time to get ’em
sometimes. Have to tell ’em all kinds of lies.”</p>

<p class='c006'>So here we have a certain kind of “scientific
management” of child labor
by means of which even the
vacation time of the children is
utilized.</p>

<p class='c006'>“Why do they do it?”—that
question comes to one over and
over; what keeps these little ones
at their uninteresting task? In
the first place, their immigrant
parents are frugal, even parsimonious,
and every little helps.
Then they think it keeps the children
out of trouble, little realizing
that they are storing up
trouble when they grow up,
handicapped by lack of education,
broken physically, and with a distaste
for work. Small wonder if
they drift into the industrial
maelstrom of cheap, inefficient
labor, and float on as industrial
misfits.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we look at it from the employer’s
point of view, we find his
chief justification is that children
are needed because the goods are
perishable, and must be put up
immediately. You ask him if the
children are not perishable, and
he says he can’t see that they are
spoiled. “It doesn’t hurt ’em.
They’re tough. I began myself
at their age,” and so on. It will be long
years before these employers will be looking
at this children’s labor with a long-range finder,
a problem to be met along with that of improved
machinery. The children themselves are
docile; they do as they are told; they are imitative,
like to do what the rest are doing; they are
easily stimulated by the idea of competing with
other children; and they are very sensitive to
criticism and ridicule. I do not, however, recall
a single case of a child being whipped for
not working. It can easily be seen that with the
parents, or employers, and children against it,
the task of liberation from this commercialized
family peonage of immature workers is not an
easy one.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the Atlantic Coast more Negroes are employed,
than on the Gulf Coast, and they do not
work the children very much, except where they
have come under the influence of the immigrant
workers. In almost every case, the bosses and
padrones agree that the Baltimore workers are
much more satisfactory than the Negroes. They
say:</p>

<p class='c006'>“There is no comparing them. The whites
work harder, longer hours, are more easily driven,
and use the children much
more.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The chief advantage of Negro
help is that it saves the cost of
transportation. Where it is necessary
to get the work done promptly
the immigrants are imported.</p>

<p class='c006'>That this exploitation of the
children is absolutely unnecessary
is proven by the canneries that
get along without them. It needs
merely more efficient planning on
the part of the managers, and
better supervision on the part of
the state. It is certainly a condition
not to be endured when we
consider the hardships involved—the
long hours, the monotonous
and tiring work, the irregular
conditions of work and of life,
the exposure, the unsanitary surroundings,
the moral dangers, the
lack of education, and the double
exploitation of summer and
winter.</p>

<p class='c006'>One morning I found a little
cannery worker setting about her
endless job. At the end of the
day as I passed near, human
nature asserted itself. She asked
me to photograph her dolly too,
this oyster shucker.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Kate Douglas
Wiggin, in
one of her
most appealing stories,
tells of a child who
was walking in a garden
with his mother
when they came upon
a misshapen tree. In
reply to the mother’s
question as to why the
tree was crooked the
child replied that he
guessed someone had
stepped on it when it
was little. So it is with
many of the children
in our larger cities—they
get stepped on
physically, intellectually
and spiritually
when they are young.</p>

<p class='c006'>Little Ivan, whose
mother had come here
from Russia after
passing through we
know not how many
scenes of terror and
suffering, bore the
stamp of her misery
on his face and in his
soul. When he came
to a New York public
school at eight years
of age it seemed impossible
that teacher
and textbook should be
able to do anything for
him. He was ragged
and dirty and could
not speak. But after
patient effort the
teacher of the special
class, where he had
been put, found that he
was not a mute and
that he did understand
English. Next, his
mother was seen, and
she became so interested
in her boy’s welfare
that his ragged days
were brought to an
end. A new suit of
clothes and a clean
face transformed him
into an intelligent and
alert looking youngster.
Now he is struggling
with the words,
“boy and ran, dog and
book,” and is attacking
the other branches with
some notion of what
they are all about. His
destructive tendency is
being dealt with firmly
and patiently, and there
are great hopes that
some day Ivan may
develop into a normal
and sturdy boy.</p>

<p>NELLO, THE “UTTERLY BAD”<br>  <br>  Until a visiting teacher went to his home and found his mother dying of cancer, Nello nursing her and the three younger children, and the father sharing his morning beer with the undersized boy. The schoolroom tantrum was understood then. Nello was sent to the country.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>This story of Ivan
is a good illustration of
what the school can do
to help prevent the little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>trees from being so harshly trodden upon. It is also
a good illustration of the manner in which they
can do it. For it is one of the most promising
signs of our times that our conception of the
process called education is a constantly broadening
one. It is no longer enough to teach children
to read, write and cipher, even to draw,
cook and sew. We have been in the past contented
with the dictum that the public schools
exist in order to abolish illiteracy, but now we
are inclined to take the fuller meaning which,
surprisingly enough, the dictionary gives: “to
educate is to qualify for the business and duties
of life.” Up to now, unfortunately, the dictionary
has not been followed with too great
care. Much time has been lost and from the
results of this loss we are now suffering. In
our new vision, the schools must not only train
children toward constructive citizenship, but
must do what they can to prevent the development
of destructive citizens, must help in overcoming
completely the original anti-social condition
into which psychologists tell us children
are born.</p>

<p class='c006'>Industrial teaching and vocational guidance
through the public schools should do much to
bring about this training toward constructive
citizenship. But for the equally important task
of prevention some preliminary work must be
done. Obstacles must be removed. Those who
can profit by such training must be sifted out
from those who cannot, and through the schools
we must fit by some preliminary process, those
who at first sight seem unfit. For in the schools
are often found the beginning of all the bitter
problems with which our strongest philanthropic
organizations are struggling so manfully. “Millions
for cure, nothing for prevention” sometimes
seems to express pretty clearly where the
emphasis has been placed in the past. The schools
can help greatly if they would get back behind
the present situation, and discuss, point out, and
if necessary, perform these acts of prevention.</p>

<p class='c006'>What does all this mean? It means that social
service must come to be regarded as a justifiable
function of the schools, as justifiable as it has
already become in the case of at least two other
institutions.</p>

<p class='c006'>Upwards of twenty years ago a militant clergyman
in New York is quoted as having said: “It
is all very well to talk of saving souls, but I
never yet have seen a soul that was not connected
with a body.” At that time religious work was
confined much more closely than it now is within
certain traditional limits, and these ringing words
did much to turn the attention of the churches
toward their old ideal of social service.</p>

<p class='c006'>A later grafting of the spirit of social service
on long established practices is shown in
the progress of hospital social service. What
first opened the eyes of the medical profession
is not recorded, but it was soon proven that the
assurance given to a woman at the hospital that
her children were being well cared for in her
absence hastened her recovery, and that the
visits of a wise and sympathetic nurse or trained
social worker to the home of a discharged patient
almost always succeeded in preventing that patient’s
return because of a relapse due to carelessness
or ignorance. A physician in a large
Boston hospital where the social service is famous
for its completeness and efficiency has said
that a good social service nurse saves her salary
twice over by the cures she hastens and the
returns she prevents.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is a tradition in this country on which
we greatly pride ourselves, that education, at
least in certain of its fundamental branches, is
free to all who wish to avail themselves of the
opportunity afforded by the state. Indeed, we
go so far in most of our states as to make it
not only free but compulsory between certain
ages. But look carefully through any large
school and many a small one, and you will find
children who would gladly partake of this free
education but who for many reasons, and
through no fault of their own, are unable to
do so. Children who sit idly in school or stumble
blindly through a grade or two, and children
whose names are finally taken from the
register because for them no place in school can
be made. And so we come to see that our free
education is for those fortunate ones who are
fitted for it, while for others it is practically
non-existent. You can compel a child to go to
school, but you cannot compel him to profit
by his stay there.</p>

<p class='c006'>The story of Nello is a pathetic illustration
of this. Here was a boy of eleven, pitifully
small for his age, who had been placed in an
ungraded class, and was disturbing the class and
distracting the teacher by his utter badness. A
visitor was asked to investigate the home conditions
and find out a possible explanation for
his incorrigibility. She found ample cause.
Nello’s mother was dying of cancer. His father
was a heavy drinker, often out of work, who
shared his beer with the small boy instead of
getting proper food for him each morning.
Nello was the only nurse his mother and the
three younger children had, and his burden of
responsibility gave him no other outlet except
the schoolroom tantrum. A nurse and proper
food were secured. The two youngest children
were placed temporarily in an institution. Nello
was taken to a doctor who said that the boy
was permanently dwarfed because of his alcoholic
diet, and the father was induced to discontinue
this and give him milk instead. With
better food and some time in the country it
may be proved that Nello is only temporarily
dwarfed mentally, even if his physical state is
permanent. In any event, with the burden, too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>great for his narrow shoulders, finally removed
the boy is now doing well in school and his
future is not hopeless.</p>

<p>CLASS FOR ANAEMIC CHILDREN IN A NEW YORK PUBLIC SCHOOL<br>  <br>  When the room is in a building the windows are so arranged that the largest amount of air is taken into the room. The windows are never closed.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Happily certain phases of the situation are
now being remedied. Through the increase in
the differentiation of special classes within the
schools our educational systems are making education
more nearly free to all, and so taking
a most important part in the great work of prevention.
We are ceasing to think quite so exclusively
of the ambulances at the foot of the
precipice and are building our fence, foot by
foot, across its top. By means of these special
classes, the different demands which differently
constituted minds and bodies make are in great
part met, the fact that certain obstacles prevent
many minds from attaining full development is
recognized; and due allowance is made for the
effect physical and mental handicaps have on
individual education.</p>

<p class='c006'>To give an instance: In the public schools
of New York these special classes are carried
out to an admirable extent. Physical handicaps
are recognized and provided for in the classes
for cripples, for blind, anaemic and tubercular
children, and in the School for the Deaf. The
teachers of these classes come to know a great
deal about the homes and the individual difficulties
of their pupils, and what home or medical
care will be of the greatest assistance to them
educationally. Bodies are cared for, lunches
even are furnished, that the mind may have a
chance to grow strong and keen—for the school
lunch is more and more recognized as a real
factor in education.</p>

<p class='c006'>For the backward children and for those who
are mentally rather than physically defective,
there are other special classes; those for the
over-age children, for foreigners who come to
school before they have learned to speak English,
for children who are trying to get their
working papers, and the so-called Ungraded
Class for those who are apparently or really
backward to a hopeless extent. Often members
of this latter group find their way into the
classes for foreign children or those who are
trying for working papers, so limiting the best
usefulness of those classes.</p>

<p class='c006'>But one step further must be taken, and in
some places and in some connections is being
taken in this work of prevention, and of bringing
together the incomplete little being and his
opportunity for becoming more complete. This
step is the adaptation of the ideal of social service
to our educational work and through it we
shall finally come to see, I believe, the supremely
important part the schools must play in the
solution of our most perplexing social problems.
Often this part will be not to take the actual
steps themselves, but to point out to other especially
equipped agencies the steps that must be
taken by them in order to prevent future misery
and crime. From the schools must come our
most valuable information and advice concerning
the treatment of various groups of dependent
children. They constitute the great dragnet
and the natural clearing house.</p>

<p class='c006'>The day is fast coming when just as surely
as social service is an inseparable and honored
part of both religious and medical institutions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>so it shall be of our educational work. Phases
of this service or movements closely allied to it,
are already being slowly introduced into the
public school systems of some cities, volunteer
agencies are carrying on a more definite social
service in close connection with the schools, and
always a good teacher, interested to learn of
the home surroundings of her pupils, is the most
effective social service worker the schools can
have.</p>

<p class='c006'>But when the effort is made to introduce direct
social service into the school system itself
a suspicion has often been felt on the part of
the governing body, or on that of the taxpayer,
that here is an attempt to turn the schools into
charitable centers. They do not seem to realize
nor take to heart the message of that minister
of twenty years ago that while it is all very well
to talk about training the mind, no one has ever
yet seen a mind that was not connected with a
body. The obstacles which often prevent the
mind’s full development must be discovered and
removed before the education the schools offer
can be taken full advantage of. The same close
relationship which hospital social service bring
about with a patient’s home must be established
by the school with the homes of its pupils—as in
the case of Nello—so that any hindrance to a
child’s education existing there may be ascertained
and as far as possible overcome. Much
social service of a valuable kind has been carried
on in connection with some of the special
classes in the New York city schools by outside
agencies devoted to the care of particular forms
of physical defect, and their assistance to both
teachers and pupils has been generous and effective.
In some cases the closest relation has
existed between these organizations and the
school system, as in the case of the classes for
cripples. But as yet none of this work has been
made an actual part of the system, though its
value is recognized and the volunteer service
used to the fullest extent.</p>

<p>CLASS FOR CRIPPLED CHILDREN IN A NEW YORK PUBLIC SCHOOL<br>  <br>  Note the adjustable chairs which can be suited to the particular difficulty of the child occupying it. Much manual work is done in these classes.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Last year the social worker who was supplied
to the department of ungraded classes of the
New York public schools by the Public Education
Association proved abundantly the need for
such work in connection with all the special
classes for children who are backward from any
cause whatever. Children who appeared to be
hopelessly defective were taken by this worker
to hospitals or clinics and found to be far more
nearly normal than had been at first supposed.
Children who seemed to be in immediate danger
of getting into evil ways because of their mental
defect and whose parents were unequal to the task
of keeping them from harming themselves or
others, were placed in institutions where they
could be taught and cared for. Out of a hundred
cases investigated the visitor succeeded in
placing nineteen in institutions. Unwillingness on
the part of parents or lack of room in the institutions
prevented putting the others there
also. On the other hand, the child who could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>not remain in the regular grades because of
mental weakness was visited at home, his difficulties
explained to the parents, who were ignorantly
and often cruelly blaming him for a fault
not his own, and he was finally placed, with the
parents’ full understanding and consent, in an
ungraded class. Adjustments have been made
which will affect many a child’s whole career
for good, advice has been given at home which
has in some cases changed the status of an entire
family.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p>GROUP FROM A CLASS FOR FOREIGN CHILDREN IN A NEW YORK PUBLIC SCHOOL<br>  <br>  These children of immigrant parents enter the class immediately on landing.  The average stay is three months, when they go out into the regular grades for which they are fitted, according to the previous education they have had in their own countries.  One teacher says: “They absorb just like little sponges.  They are so eager to learn.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Because of the work done by this visitor and
the effective way in which the inspector of ungraded
classes has incorporated her work into
the general plan for these classes; and also on
account of the recommendation made by the
State Charities Aid Association that more
knowledge should be secured by the schools of
the atypical children there, the New York Board
of Education has decided to install two such
visitors in the Department of Ungraded Classes.
This is the first time, so far as I know, that an
appropriation has been made by a school system
for such a purpose. It is a step towards fulfilling
this newer ideal of education of which New
York city may well be proud.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is impossible to measure the good that
would result if this service were widened to include
the other classes for backward children
I have mentioned, particularly the working paper
classes. At the Board of Health the other
day a pretty Italian girl of fifteen was examined
for her working paper. Her writing of the
simplest English sentence was so poor that her
paper was refused, and she was told she must
stay in school until she was sixteen. The girl
and her father came in despair to appeal to the
head of the department. It was not a case of
poverty; the father had work, and so had older
brothers and sisters. On the girl’s side it was
discontent and restlessness—“I do not want to
go to school any more; they scold me all the
time.” She had been in a special working paper
class and had undoubtedly been dull and
unambitious. The father had a more serious
story. His English was halting, they talked
only Italian at home, he told me, which accounted
somewhat for the girl’s curious mistakes.
But the mother was dead, the older sister working,
and there was no one at home to look after
the girl in her hours after school. The father’s
distressed face showed clearly his perplexity as
to the chaperonage of his daughter according to
the Italian ideas. It was not safe or proper that
she should be at home alone or wandering about
the streets; she was better off at work. Whether
the father’s statement was true or not, without
much question the girl will never go regularly
to school again, if she goes at all—in spite
of attendance officers and all—and for another
year she cannot go legally to work. It is not
hard to guess the sequel, and the remedy is
equally easy to see. How long will it take us
to learn that when we take something from
young people which they must not have, we
must at the same moment supply its place with
something desirable but safe. Social service
directly connected with the school would solve
the future of the pretty little Italian and of
many others in the same evil case. They want
not only the careful schooling that will correct
the lack which prevents them from going to
work, but, more than that, the home visiting
which shall explain the need for this further
training and arouse interest in the connection
between school and work.</p>

<p class='c006'>The best example of volunteer social service
in connection with the public schools is that
which for several years has been carried on by
various outside agencies interested in linking
more closely the school and the home, but always
limited to work with the regular grades.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Home and School League of Philadelphia
has done valuable work in arousing interest in
this direction, and now a number of such visitors
are at work in the city supported by various
private organizations. They are doing
the same sort of work as that done by the visitors
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>in New York and Boston, although from
the reports it would seem that both in Philadelphia
and Boston special attention is given by
them to vocational guidance. A particularly
valuable piece of work has been done by the
home visitor appointed by the Armstrong Association
to work among the colored pupils of
Philadelphia; the Friend’s Preventive Association,
the Juvenile Protective Association, and
the Children’s Aid Societies, also support visitors.
These are being used to an increasing
degree by the Bureau of Compulsory Education
of Philadelphia in carrying on the preventive
work connected with that bureau.</p>

<p class='c006'>In Boston there are now five full-time and
seven or eight part time school visitors. Each
visitor is engaged by some private organization,
such as the Women’s Educational Association,
the Home and School Association, a group of
settlements, or by some individual. She is attached
to a special school or district and does
all her work there. This is the arrangement in
all three cities. The work has been supervised
by a committee of the Women’s Educational Association,
and this committee represents settlements
and other social agencies. Work of this
sort, but on a smaller scale, is being done both in
Worcester, Mass., and in Rochester, N. Y.,
the visiting teachers working under the Public
Education Association of New York have been
increasingly effective in their efforts to solve
for the often overburdened teacher problems
connected with individual children.</p>

<p class='c006'>Efforts have been made from time to time by
the supervising force to instruct teachers to visit
the homes of the children in their classrooms
and ascertain the conditions under which they
were living, but with the present large size of
classes in most public schools this has been
found to be quite impracticable. Besides this,
to overcome the difficulties in the way of a
child’s education much visiting of an expert sort
and many efforts for outside co-operation are
often necessary, for which the teachers could
not possibly find time. Separate visitors are
therefore needed. There are so many illustrations
of the sort of work they do, that it is hard
to select one that is more telling than the rest.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the report of a Boston visitor we learn
of Angelina Conti, who was constantly tardy,
frequently absent, and never alert or quick in
her recitations. “She seems to lack ambition,”
says the report, “and must be dropped into a
lower grade unless something can be done to
brace her up.” The visitor is sent to the home.
She finds that Angelina is the oldest of nine
children and that the family lives in three rooms.
The burden of the family seems to rest on Angelina,
who must wash the clothes every afternoon
when she comes from school, and go for
the baby’s milk before school in the morning.
Angelina is a perfectly compliant, patient little
soul. She has a headache most of the time, but
expects to do all that her mother asks of her.
She hopes that the teacher won’t “degrade” her.</p>

<p class='c006'>The visitor urges Mrs. Conti to send a
younger child for milk in the morning so that
Angelina can come promptly to school. The
headaches are reported to the school nurse, who
sends Angelina to the hospital for much needed
treatment. The whole situation is explained to
the teacher, who gladly promises to send Angelina
home promptly in the afternoon so that
she may have time for her housework. There
is a much better understanding between Angelina
and her teacher, her health improves, she
comes more regularly and keeps her class. Thus
is the first step in preventing dependency taken.</p>

<p class='c006'>An interesting part of the work of these social
service workers has been to bring to bear
on the lives of these “difficult children” all the
agencies which might be of assistance. This
same Boston visitor states in her report that
“this new work of visiting the homes of the
school children is one of continual co-operation
with principals, teachers, truant officers, janitors
and the children themselves, also with hospitals,
dispensaries, employment agencies, the
Associated Charities, or whatever the emergency
may demand.” Too often this sort of
effort is scattered and ineffective because of the
lack of connection between agencies. With a
visitor working from the school as a starting
point and not from any private organization,
the connection is quickly made and the influence
of each helping agency is strengthened by the
added influence of every other. This has proved
to be just as true in the case of medical social
service, particularly that of public hospitals and
institutions, and one might almost prophesy that
some day the relief work of philanthropic agencies
will come only in response to calls from the
social service departments of church, hospital,
public institution and school, and that a great
clearing house for these agencies, public and private,
will be the best way of organizing charity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Be that as it may, social service is as surely
needed in connection with training people’s
minds as it is with saving their souls and curing
their bodies. It is easier to train our vines to
grow straight and sure and to cling to the lattices
we choose for them, if at the same time
the soil is watered and enriched that the roots
may be strong, and all things harmful to the
plant’s health are carefully kept from it. “As
the twig is bent the tree’s inclined,” but the twig
must be strong and healthy as well as straight,
if the tree is to do its part in forming the forests
our country must have if it would be prosperous.
Surely anything that will make more
effective the mental training and development of
our country’s future citizens is as fully justified.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Walter preferred to play ball under the
kindly protection of the Queensborough
Bridge to attending school where he
had no chance to show his ability as a leader.
He had successfully evaded all the visits of the
truant officer, and when his teacher asked me, a
visiting teacher, to try my luck, I wondered what
I should find. I called first upon his mother at
her place of business and found her in thorough
sympathy with the school, but apparently powerless
to make her son attend. Walter took advantage
of the fact that she left the house before
he did, and as they alone comprised the family,
he could disobey her and go to school or not as
he saw fit. There was no one but himself to
report to her in the evening just how he had
spent his day.</p>

<p class='c006'>I chose supper time for my first visit, and found
him, as I hoped, at home, a little tired from his
day’s play and hungry, of course. His mother
was there too. She was surprised when I told
her that her son had not attended school that
day, nor indeed for many days previously. We
talked of many things, and just before leaving,
I ventured to ask Walter what he wanted to be
when he was a man. He was then twelve years
old. He did not hesitate an instant. He wanted,
he said, to be an architect. And then his mother
showed me a little calendar he had painted which
adorned the closet door. We struck a bargain.
If he went to school regularly, I was to arrange
with his teacher to give him a palette and brushes
so that he could paint. It was possible to do
this as he was in a special class in which the
course of study is more easily adapted to the
child’s needs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The next morning, when I opened the classroom
door, two pairs of smiling eyes greeted
me—the teacher’s and Walter’s. At once the
teacher and I planned our campaign. Walter
was to learn that at school he could get a chance
at leadership too, for could he not play games
there? At first, perhaps, they seemed tame compared
with those under the bridge, for the classroom
or the school-yard, even when given over
to ball or bean-bag, does not easily associate itself
in the child’s mind with scenes of adventure.
However, the chance of some time being captain
of the team had charms even for him. The
proof is to be found in the fact that he attended
school regularly, earning, in so doing, his palette
and brushes and at the end of the term promotion
to a regular class.</p>

<p class='c006'>The work of the visiting teacher has passed
the experimental stage. The position was created
to bridge a gap in the existing school machinery.
The visiting teacher’s province lies outside that
of the regular teacher, the attendance officer and
the school nurse, though like the attendance officer
and the school nurse, she goes into the child’s
home. To her is assigned the group called the
“difficult” children, and it is her aim to discover,
if possible, the cause of the difficulty which
manifests itself in poor scholarship, annoying
conduct, irregular attendance, or the need of or
desire for advice on some important phase of
life. It is too much to expect the regular teacher,
handicapped as she is by her large class, to cope
with such situations. Nor is it to be expected
that those qualified to act as attendance officer
or school nurse, were they not already overburdened,
should do the work of the visiting teacher.
In her is united the training that makes a teacher
and a social service worker, and it is because
of this combination that she is able to widen the
regular teacher’s reach and help her interpret
and solve the problems as they present themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>From the school she learns that the child is
apparently making little effort; that his work is
“C” or worse; that he is perpetually making
trouble in the class room and is never attentive:
that he seems lifeless, unable to keep pace with
the class; that he attends so irregularly that it
is impossible to teach him anything, or that he
has no time to study and the situation at home
is such that he must leave school and go to work.
With these facts as clues she sets to work;
it is impossible to define her methods, for they
vary with her tact and resourcefulness and with
the specific character of the problem before her.
Briefly, they are the methods that spring from a
friendly interest, an intimate personal relation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Between the home and the school the visiting
teacher vibrates, carrying to the former the
school’s picture of the child and returning to the
school to reinforce that impression or to shed
new light upon the problem. There is no fixed
number of times that she is expected to travel
this path, as there is no fixed hour of the day
for her visits. The urgency and complexity of
a situation alone determine her movements. Nor
is there any regular routine of action that she
follows. Whatever in her judgment seems imperative,
she endeavors to effect, using to this
end everything the ingenuity of man has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>devised to make smooth the rough places of life.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is a focussing of interests that she demands.
The child is the pivotal point on which she hopes
to bring all her knowledge and experience to
bear. Sometimes it is the expert teacher’s training
that she invokes; sometimes the psychologist
or the physician, general or special, that she consults;
or again it is the social worker to whom
she appeals. Before these she lays the facts,
the reasons why her services have been sought
and from them she asks co-operation. To the
adult, she is the visiting teacher; to the child,
she is simply the “lady cop.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The results achieved do not always show a
complete cure. In some cases there has been a
marked improvement in scholarship, conduct or
attendance,—at least a good start in the right
direction has been made. In other cases the
child has been transferred to a different class,
regular, special or ungraded, or to a trade school,
where his chances at succeeding in making a
place for himself are increased. Again, the information
the visiting teacher shares with the
regular teacher has resulted in a change of attitude
toward the child, in an expansion or contraction
of the course of study, or in her giving
the child extra instruction in study periods or
out of school hours. Finally, he has been helped
to promotion, even to graduation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Last year 1,157 cases were handled by the seven
visiting teachers maintained in New York by the
Public Education Association. The majority of
these came directly through the school, but in a
few instances the visiting teacher was called in
by the child’s mother, a neighbor, or the child
himself, all of whom, looking to her for help,
show not only an appreciation of the fact that
something is wrong, but also an understanding
of what the visiting teacher is trying to accomplish.
Their appeal emphasizes the necessity for
just such a connection as she makes. Other cases
came through settlements, charity organizations,
churches, or the visiting teacher herself, whose
attention had been attracted to some child on
her rounds through the classrooms. In every
instance, however, before the child technically
becomes a case, the principal and teacher are
conferred with. His school record must show
him to be below standard in either scholarship,
conduct or attendance, or in need of such advice
or information as will, if followed, enhance his
general well being.</p>

<p class='c006'>Five hundred and five of the children visited
were below standard in scholarship. This deficiency
might be due to any one of a number of
causes directly traceable to “home conditions,”
such as congested or unsanitary living quarters,
child labor, “overburdened childhood,” and ignorance
of or indifference to the school’s claims.
Or it might be that some school adjustment
was necessary; for example, de-moting the child
that is mentally and physically unequal to the
grade’s requirements; or drawing him out in
recitations, should he be nervous or timid; or
helping him in the preparation of the studies that
trouble him.</p>

<p class='c006'>Three hundred and thirteen children were below
standard in conduct; that is, they were either
out of sympathy with the school environment or
they were guilty of some offence, such as stealing,
lying, cheating, or sexual irregularity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Four hundred and sixty-five children were
irregular in attendance. Since the same child
is sometimes below standard in scholarship and
irregular in attendance, or in need of advice and
information, the groups here mentioned often
overlap and the numbers total more than 1,157.</p>

<p class='c006'>Six hundred and seventy-five needed advice
or information. In all of these cases the child
needed someone to plead his cause either at
home or at school, that he might be the more
thoroughly understood and that his special need,
whether it be recreational, physical, or vocational,
might be satisfied.</p>

<p class='c006'>The task of the visiting teacher is plain. She
must get at the facts. This she does by studying
closely the child’s environment, realizing that he
is the product of varied associations and influences.
There are circles within circles—the
home, the school, the immediate neighborhood,
and what at times seems almost “beyond his
ken,” the great wide world itself. No analysis
of the forces that in their play and interplay
tend to shape this young life would be complete
that did not include the shifting, kaleidoscopic
scenes amid which so often his plastic years are
spent; nor would the picture be lifelike did it
not show upon its face the changes that are
wrought through that remoter contact with men
and things.</p>

<p class='c006'>The action followed depends naturally upon
what the investigation reveals. Should the home
be at fault, then an effort is made to remove the
“trouble maker,” and, should this be impossible,
then effort is made at least to effect some compromise,
the benefit of which the child will reap
both in the home and in the school.</p>

<p class='c006'>Margaret had many times struck a discordant
note in the classroom. At home she had always
had her own way. Small wonder, then, that
she played the prank she did in the assembly.
In the midst of the gathering of some five hundred
children when the morning exercises were
being held, she spoke loud enough to be disturbing,
and when reprimanded and told to leave
the hall, she walked its full length on her heels,
thus creating a greater disturbance and openly
defying the principal’s authority. She was sent
home and the matter was explained to her parents.
The child felt that she had been insulted
because ordered from the room, and the mother,
unfortunately, took her side. At first she could
not be made to see that if her child saw fit to
leave the hall as she chose, the other 499 might
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>use their wits to the same end and pandemonium
result. Only after repeated interviews with the
visiting teacher and after the child had lost fully
a month of school did the mother allow her to
return.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sometimes it happens that the child has
neither time nor place to study. “The noise, it
gets me all mixed up,” is her pathetic comment.
The neighborhood is scoured till a quiet room
is found, either in a settlement, a sisterhood,
or a public library, and then the mother’s co-operation
is enlisted and many times secured
when she understands that noise, interruptions
and general disorder are not conducive to the
formation of good habits of study.</p>

<p class='c006'>Should it happen that the child’s work is seriously
impaired because his sleep is interfered
with, either because the mother’s work is carried
late into the night and goes on in the child’s
so-called bedroom, or because he is allowed to
partake too freely of tea and coffee, the injurious
effects of this way of living are demonstrated
and the family is, in the one case, urged to
move to better rooms, and in the other, plead
with until milk and cocoa are substituted for tea
and coffee. If then, the longed-for change sets
in, showing itself in the child’s ability to make
normal responses at school, word is carried to
the home and thereby is strengthened the bond
that makes these two centers one in their desire
to promote the child’s well being.</p>

<p class='c006'>But there are times when the cause is not
so obvious and does not lend itself so easily
to a simple solution. It happens often that what
to the school appears a lack of co-operation on
the part of the home means only that the parents
have tried and failed. Again and again the visiting
teacher is besought “Use your influence,”
“Come and advise us,” “Robert” or “Alice,”
“pays attention to you,”—all of which reduced
to its lowest terms means that somewhere there
is failure to understand. “It is because we are
treated as we are at home that we run the
streets,” is the way one girl of fourteen sums
up the situation.</p>

<p class='c006'>On the other hand it may happen that the
source of the difficulty is to be found in the
school itself, in the conditions that surround the
child there, which, in the light of the information
gathered in the home, expose to view some
serious maladjustment. Perhaps it is a case of
simple misunderstanding between teacher and
pupil, the former holding the latter to a sort of
rule-of-thumb scale of measurement when, mentally
and physically, the child is incapable of following.
Handicapped by nature, perhaps one of
a long line similarly affected, is it to be expected
that his reactions will be what in age and grade
they should be? For such as he the hope lies in
a curriculum so elastic that at some point the
spark of interest cannot fail to be struck.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the class room Lillian, a frail girl of thirteen,
had apparently made only the impression
of being a slow, sleepy, listless child. The
first interviews showed her ill at ease. She
studied hard every evening, she insisted; but
when she was questioned in the class all the carefully
memorized facts flew to the winds, she
was so afraid. History was her Waterloo.
Try as she would, she could not conquer. The
outlook was not promising. The visit to the
home revealed that she loved to draw. Tony,
the black and white spaniel, and Nellie, his fox-terrier
companion, had up to that time been her
only models. In her leisure moments she
sketched them lying before the kitchen stove,
or curled up, asleep, under the table.</p>

<p class='c006'>When her teacher was told how she was found
occupying her time at home, her reply was
prompt: “Yes, I remember now, she does seem
fond of drawing.” A conference was arranged
with the principal and a way was found of giving
Lillian a chance to develop further this gift,
her one excellency. Her fifth grade work was
so re-arranged as to allow her to take drawing
with the seventh grade, where she found greater
variety and a teacher eager to let her express
herself. At the same time she was introduced
to a volunteer worker, a woman to whom history
was an unending joy and with her she spent
evening after evening making friends with facts,
people, and dates that up to that moment had
been total strangers to her. Later she was transferred
to a trade school in which she was given
an opportunity to specialize in designing.</p>

<p class='c006'>In some pupils what appears as indifference
or inattention may in truth be only a temperamental
peculiarity which, if individual attention
were possible, would in time be modified. The
relation of pupil and teacher is at bottom one of
sympathetic understanding. This is why sometimes,
where one fails, the other succeeds, and
herein lies the advantage of having several
teachers to a grade. It makes possible a shifting
about and increases the child’s chances of being
understood. The desirability of this cannot be
overestimated.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another way in which the need of unusual
children is met is the so-called “rapid progress
class,” into which are put those children who
are capable of making more than two grades in
a year. Strange as it may on the surface appear,
some of the children entrusted to the
charge of the visiting teacher prove in the end
to be just this type. For one reason or another,
the routine of the regular class does not hold
the child’s interest, and, as we all know, in such
instances energy like that will not remain pent
up. It is in its determination to find an outlet
that it comes into conflict with established
order.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sometimes it is best to give the child a training
wholly different from that offered by the
school he is attending. Not all minds respond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>alike to the same stimuli. It often seems an
utter waste to insist upon children plodding doggedly
at subjects which make no appeal to them.
Here lies the opportunity for vocational training.
More than one case of apathy on the part
of a child has been dispelled when a chance was
given him to express himself in some sort of
manual or industrial activity.</p>

<p class='c006'>Occasionally it is found that at neither the
door of the home nor at that of the school can
the whole blame for the child’s failure to live
up to his best moments be laid. There are times
when he is under the kindly influence, if such
it be, of neither one nor the other. It is at such
times that his energies should be given a chance
at wholesome expression, so that they may not
be tempted to seek the baser kinds, in which the
streets of a large city abound. It is interesting
to note how a beneficient “wider view” reacts
upon the school and home environment, making
of what was once a listless, joyless, or obstinate,
untractable, child one that gives out in
“measure brimful and overflowing” the happiness
that was but his birthright.</p>

<p class='c006'>The question that naturally suggests itself is
What is the result of the action taken? What
outcome can be expected from having secured
active co-operation in 568 homes; from having
changed the class of 92 children, the school of
56, and made other school adjustments for 125;
from having called into play 288 outside agencies
in the shape of clubs, classes, and excursions
and 604 agencies such as hospitals, relief
societies, day nurseries, scholarship funds, reformatories,
settlements, public libraries, etc.,
and from having sent 208 children to the country
on extended visits?</p>

<p class='c006'>A statistical reply is not always feasible. Certain
stages in the child’s school career are
marked: certain data about it definite enough;
but whether in the final summing up these shall
be given precedence over the subtler, more elusive
changes that have come about, that is the
real question. Just as in the matter of method
employed, so in the matter of result achieved,
it must be remembered that the numerical
reckoning does not tell the whole story.</p>

<p class='c006'>To the casual observer it might appear that
the test to be applied to the visiting teacher’s
work is embraced in the single word “promotion.”
The greater the number of promotions,
therefore, the greater her measure of success.
In a measure this is true and the work stands
it. But this is not all. Our object is to find for
each child his suitable niche, and if to achieve
this means a de-motion instead of a promotion,
it must not on that account be reckoned as a
failure. To the child it may mean a new birth.
In his changed surroundings he may gain self-confidence
and no longer be a laggard and a
drag upon his class. To his teacher and his
classmates little by little he will present a different
front. The magic door has been opened.
Into what lies beyond he can enter and with the
rest can follow, and because of this there springs
up between him and them a new relation, one
that satisfies his human craving for friendship
and sympathy. In which column, the debit or
the credit, of our yearly ledger, are such items
to be placed?</p>

<p class='c006'>With final judgments tempered by such considerations,

<p class='c012'>[<i>The philosophy of vocational guidance has been often written. But it is from
the actual cases of boys and girls, influenced to this course of conduct or that, that the
general public can best get an intimate notion of how this new function of the schools
counts in the life of youth. The stories in the following article represent typical experiences
and services of such teacher-counselors as Miss Wentworth, who was
formerly vocational counselor in the High School of Practical Arts, and Eleanor M.
Colleton, whose work among the Italians and other children of the North End in Boston
has had merit of a high order.</i></p>

<p class='c012'><i>The latter part of the article is a digest, telling of past performances and future
plans, of a report which the Vocation Bureau will shortly make public, covering its
work for the last three years.</i>—Ed.]</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>In the morning mail of the Boston Vocation
Bureau appeared, not long ago, an interesting
letter. It came from a sixteen-year-old
boy who had heard of the bureau, but was
prevented by his job from coming to it for help.
He wrote asking for a special appointment, which
was granted.</p>

<p class='c006'>At the interview following, the boy, Charles
Lee, told of his position and of his home conditions.
He was an only son, living with a
widowed mother in Cambridge, and had been
obliged to leave school and go to work, taking
whatever place he could find. This was a position
as assistant shipper in the sub-basement
of a clothing store in Boston. The employer in
the beginning had promised him promotion or
transfer, but had failed to do anything for so
long a time that it became clear nothing would
be done as long as the boy was content to remain
in the sub-basement at $3.00 a week.</p>

<p class='c006'>Young Lee was a boy of attractive appearance,
earnest manner, and evidently of more
than average ability. He seemed well equipped
for a business position and desired one with a
good line of advancement.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Vocation Bureau had just completed the
investigation of a large and well known dry
goods store in the city, and now sent Lee with a
letter to its employment manager, who took him
into the office at $6.00 a week. The boy has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>been followed up by the bureau, and has shown
marked business ability in his new position. He
is now in line for promotion to an executive
position in the firm. The help given him was
based upon his home and employment conditions,
apparent abilities, and desire to find the right
place in a mercantile occupation.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mary Schenck confided to her teacher that she
wanted to take up stenography and typewriting
because she “knew a girl who had a good job
in that line.” A vocational counselor called at
her home and talked with her mother. During
the visit it developed that Mary’s mother and
grandmother were both successful dressmakers
and that the girl herself had obtained very good
marks in her sewing in the grammar school.
In fact, she had made the dresses for her two
little sisters for the past two years. As a result
of this information the counselor talked
again with Mary and suggested that she take
up sewing in the school. Mary did so, even
going out to work in a shop for a while. Then
she started in business for herself. Today she
is employing two assistants. Thus by a little
common sense and thought a girl was prevented
from entering the overcrowded field of stenography
in which she probably would not have
been very successful and started in a line of
work for which she possessed natural ability and
real love.</p>

<p class='c006'>What is a vocational counselor? There are
over a hundred of them in the public schools of
Boston. They are regular teachers, designated
by the school principals to advise and co-operate
with boys and girls leaving school for work.
Two years ago an agreement between the Boston
School Committee and the Vocation Bureau
called for their appointment and they have been
meeting twice a month ever since to discuss the
educational opportunities of the city, the vocational
problems of the children and to confer
with employers and others interested. Let us
see just how their influence is made to count in
the lives of children.</p>

<p class='c006'>Vocational guidance in a school involves three
definite objects:</p>

<p class='c012'>Guiding the child while in the school.</p>

<p class='c012'>Guiding the child after leaving school.</p>

<p class='c012'>Following up the child, i.e., ascertaining
what becomes of him after he goes into
work.</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='right'><i>Courtesy Massachusetts Child Labor Committee.</i></span><br>  <br>  THEY NEVER KNEW A VOCATIONAL COUNSELOR.<br>  <br>  There is a growing belief among those who are exploring the twilight zone between education and industry that what youngsters like these need is not more help in finding jobs but more and better training before they find them.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>In the first place the ordinary high or vocational
school offers a choice of several lines of
work, and it is highly advisable to have the child
make a wise choice as to the line he is to pursue.
The best way is to have a general course offered
at the beginning during the pursuit of which the
vocational counselor studies the child and confers
with the parents as to the child’s natural
ability, etc. This combined judgment of counselor
and parent is sure to result in a much wiser
choice of work in the school than if the matter
had been left to the discretion of the child, who
is too immature to see the various occupations
in their true relationship. Parents and counselor
may meet at the school, or the counselor
may go to the home. By going into the home
discoveries are often made which could not have
come from only seeing the child and parent at
school.</p>

<p class='c006'>During the school course it is often advisable
to change a pupil from one course to another.
For example, Clara Bartlett had been taking the
millinery course with the intention of entering
the trade on graduation. Owing to her mother’s
death, she found that she must become her father’s
housekeeper at the end of the school year.
Accordingly, after talking the matter over with
the vocational counselor, Clara changed from
the millinery to the domestic science course and
obtained a very good training in cooking and
housewifery. The result was that when her
school life was over she was able to enter upon
her new work as housekeeper with a marked degree
of success.</p>

<p class='c006'>Sometimes it is necessary for a child to change
from one school to another in order that he or
she may receive the best training for a particular
need. This implies a very close and
cordial relationship between the various kinds of
vocational schools in the city. Thus a girl who
can give only one year to the preparation for
a trade should spend that year in a school where
she will get intensive work in that trade. If
she is not advised, there is danger that she
will spend her year in a school which offers a
general course in preparation for the trade
course, which will then follow in the next two
or three years. In other words, it is necessary
to take into consideration the girl’s outside obligations
and adapt her school life to them as
closely as possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, it is the duty of the vocational counselor
to see that the graduates of the school are
given the most auspicious start on life’s journey.
This may imply definitely organized placement
work or it may mean simply making recommendations.
If the work of placement is definitely
organized it should be done on a broad
social basis, for it may mean finding a position
for one girl in a millinery establishment and
guiding another into a higher institution of
learning.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>

<p><span class='right'><i>Courtesy Massachusetts Child Labor Committee.</i></span><br>  <br>  HE LEAPED BLINDLY<br>  <br>  And his only school now is the school of hard knocks, his only teacher a factory boss.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>If the work of placement is to be done by the
vocational school, great insight into the true
ability of the girl under actual business conditions
may be obtained by “part time” work.
For instance, Susan Williams, who is taking the
course in dressmaking, was placed by the school
in a near-by establishment where she spent her
afternoons and Saturdays. Here she obtained
a very definite idea of trade conditions, also
earned a little money to help with her expenses
and secured for herself by her own desirable
personality and excellent workmanship a permanent
position on graduation. In the same
way Josephine Riley, who was taking a course
in designing, was placed by the school in an
embroidery shop where she did work in designing
on Saturdays during the latter part of her
course. She too worked herself into a permanent
position for which she had demonstrated
her qualifications.</p>

<p class='c006'>Occasion often arises to provide a girl with
an opportunity to earn enough money to keep her
in school until graduation. Sometimes the work
found is similar to that pursued by the girl in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>the school. Often it is not, however, for many
times the girl can earn more money in some
other kind of work. Frances Newton, who is
taking designing, can earn more money by acting
as assistant in an office on Saturdays than she
possibly could in any designing establishment
owing to her present limited knowledge of her
trade. Thus she is tided over a financial crisis
without being deprived of her school work.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='right'><i>Courtesy Massachusetts Child Labor Committee</i></span><br>  <br>  ONE OF THE “BLIND ALLEY” TRADES<br>  <br>  This group is declared to be typical of every city and town in Massachusetts.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The third line of work for the vocational counselor
in a vocational school is that of “following
up.” This is the only way of ascertaining whether
schools are fitting the children for those
walks of life for which they are attempting to
train them. If the school is doing this satisfactorily
<i>we want</i> to know it, and if it is not
doing it <i>we ought</i> to know it. The child may
be followed up by a regular system of reporting
by mail, by visits to employes and by alumni
meetings. Alumni meetings are particularly
profitable when turned into experience meetings
at which the children tell what they have been
doing with especial emphasis on the relation of
their training in the school and their work in
the world. In this way schools can keep in
touch with their graduates and create a spirit
of friendly intercourse even after they leave.
The best advertisement a school can have is an
enthusiastic body of loyal graduates.</p>

<p class='c006'>The work of the vocational assistant in a vocational
or other school is thus one of adjustment;
adjusting children to the right course in
school; adjusting them to the right course after
they leave school; and adjusting the relationship
between the school and the home, and that
between the school and the business life.</p>

<p class='c006'>If this work is needed in a vocational school
how much more it must be needed in a regular
school! For it is an adjustment which tends
always toward keeping the children in school,
but if they must leave, insists upon seeing that
they are at least given a helping hand toward
that new life which is so different from school
life and so bewildering to the youthful mind.</p>

<p class='c006'>There is plentiful testimony that fathers and
mothers now turn to the Boston schools as never
before for advice and help in their perplexities
concerning their children’s future. It has been
most pathetic in the past to see how little parents
knew of real industrial conditions, and of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>what educational and vocational opportunities
existed in Boston, entirely within their reach.
Our experience has been that the vast majority
of parents have heretofore known nothing about
the various high schools and their specialties,
except what they have learned through the vocational
work of the school itself. The attitude
of the parents when visited in the homes, makes
it appear only too clear that practically all welcome
such guidance and are anxious to avail
themselves of it.</p>

<p class='c006'>These, then, are pictures of the vocational
counselor at work. What is the machinery behind
her? Every school in the city has at least
one teacher who has given her time freely to this
service. In some schools committees of teachers
have formed voluntarily to take thought over
the dropping out of boys and girls, and to organize
that assistance which a school can give
to parents and children in administering to the
life-career motive. The work of the vocational
counselors has been a labor of love. Nobody
has expected that the occupational talks
to which they have listened twice a month would
equip them for effective vocational guidance.
But no group of persons can listen to intimate
discussions of the shoe industry, department
stores, machine industries, stenography and
typewriting, mechanical and civil engineering,
building trades and needle trades—which have
been actual subjects in these meetings—without
being better fitted than before to advise and
guide those who are making hit-or-miss guesses
at work in the fond hope that it will pay well and
that it is suited to their particular capacities.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Vocation Bureau, through whose influence
the Boston schools were induced to introduce
vocational guidance, does not aim at
the placing of individual boys and girls in particular
jobs. It endeavors to study the causes
of the waste which attends the passing of unguided
and untrained young people from school
to work, and to assist by experiments to prevent
this waste. It aims to work out the problem
of co-operation between schools and occupations,
for the purpose of enabling both to
make a more socially profitable use of human talents
and opportunities. It publishes studies of
vocations from the viewpoint of their educational
and other efficiency requirements. It conducts
a training course for qualified men and
women who desire to prepare themselves for
vocational guidance in the public school system,
philanthropic institutions, and business establishments.
Its interests therefore lie both in the
direction of personal service to the individual
and of constructive experiment and research in
the field of education and employment.</p>

<p class='c006'>A capable investigator spends his entire time
in studying occupations open to boys and young
men, what these occupations require, and what
they lead to. From three months to a year is
devoted to each study. The result of these inquiries
is published in tentative pamphlet form.
Such pamphlets have already been published on
the machinist, banking, the baker, confectionery
manufacture, the architect, the landscape architect,
the grocer, the department store, and the
profession of law.</p>

<p class='c006'>In each of these studies it is sought to supply
parents, teachers and others interested with the
material necessary to an intelligent conception
of the occupation, its needs, demands, opportunities,
relative desirability and its training, requirements
and possibilities. It is further sought
to analyze the relation of aptitudes, interests
and habits to modern industrial demands, and
thus to lay an adequate foundation for a system
of training that regards social as well as economic
needs.</p>

<p class='c006'>The Vocation Bureau has constantly borne in
mind that a sound development of vocational
guidance requires that contact with the employments
be more than mere onlooking. To leave
the employer out of such a plan, to fail to profit
by his criticism and point of view, is to omit
one of the most important elements in such guidance.
The bureau has therefore been in close
touch with a large number of industrial and
commercial concerns in sympathy with its purposes.
Manufacturers have approved its methods,
and have even supported its demands for
more thorough-going protection and opportunity
for the young worker.</p>

<p class='c006'>To understand better the employer’s relation
to vocational guidance, the bureau organized last
year a conference of employment managers.
Men representing a score or more of important
manufacturing and business establishments have
met regularly for informal discussions. In
December an employment managers’ association
was formed. One of the most important fruits
of this close contact is the possibility of formulating
plans for organizing the generally chaotic
entrance into occupations. It is now planned to
undertake some experiments in placement work
in co-operation with several social agencies and
a group of employers. The bureau believes that
the country is ready to undertake through responsible
agencies, having in mind primarily the
needs of young workers, experiments to point
the way to some less wasteful and costly method
of bringing together what has been called “the
manless job and the jobless man.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Persons of constructive imagination throughout
the country, alert to the needs of coming
generations of workers, and interested in the
reforms which must succeed if our future citizens
are to enter into their inheritance, have
come to recognize that a new co-ordinating
agency is needed—an agency which shall secure
team play in home, school and occupation, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>the end that a richer vocational life of all the
workers may be realized. It is likely that in the
near future there will not only be for the work
in the public schools a specially trained vocational
counselor, but that there will also be in
business and manufacturing establishments a new
type of employment manager, especially trained
and empowered to develop in the worker not
only the efficiency which the employer requires,
but also that efficiency which society requires.
Through the working together of such employment
managers and school counselors, society
will gain an important factor in making for its
progress.</p>

<p>THE HOME OF A GRADUATE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Home-making has
not kept pace with
our great industrial
advancement. The average
home-maker of today is less
thoroughly prepared for her
business in life than the woman
of a generation ago. It
would seem that she considers
the home-making profession
of much less importance
than such occupations as
curling feathers and making
shirtwaists. The latter has
a commercial value, the former
has not; and we have
learned to weigh things by
their money value. Then,
again, competition has become
the one incentive to
work. Tie badly the million
little knots in the willow
plume and the next girl in the line gets the
job. Feed the baby with poor milk, let the air
in the room become polluted, ignorantly buy and
ignorantly cook, and no one takes the work from
you. Why worry over the way it is done?</p>

<p class='c006'>There are many reasons why the woman of a
generation or two ago was a better home-maker
than the woman of today. The home duties today
often are only part of the daily work of a
woman’s life. The housekeeper today is (in millions
of cases) a wage earner as well. She cannot
be as single-minded as the old-fashioned
mother whose only thought was the home.
Schools, newspapers, settlements, the trend of the
times, all fill the mind with outside interests.
These things are important, but they have a tendency
to crowd out domestic responsibilities and
make women restless under the homely tasks.
Suffrage we will have, and we must interest and
educate women until we do have it; but, at the
same time, the dishes have to be washed clean,
the beds have to be aired and
made well, and the babies
have to eat nourishing food,
or we’ll have an anaemic,
poor race to govern when
we get the suffrage.</p>

<p class='c006'>Is it the fault of the home-maker
of today if weakness
instead of strength is the inheritance
of her children,
and will it be the fault of
the home-maker of tomorrow
if she bears and rears a
weak race? If household
administration is to take
its place in the front rank
with the other professions
of the day, educators as
well as women must wake
up and realize that the
whole housekeeping question
is dependent upon scientific
management, efficiency, skilled labor, and effective
tools.</p>

<p class='c006'>There are those who say that this training
should be taught at home, and in many cases our
school children, whether foreign or American,
do come from homes where the mothers are good
housekeepers according to their light; but the
last generation cannot teach the coming one
everything. As Samuel Merwin says in a recent
book, “the accumulated experience of the
ages is the grandmothers, and yet she is authority
no longer; since her day science has stepped
in. To her mind the gulf between herself
and her daughter is nothing but the old gulf between
age and youth. She is wrong. It is a million
miles wide and if the mother keeps to the
old way she risks the life of her child.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Again, home-making must be made interesting.
The man regards his business as a pleasure. He
plays it as he plays a game, and he plays
to win. And so housekeeping has become a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“game, not a duty.” In a natural, enjoyable way
our girls should be taught to play the game of
household administration. Home duties are not
mere duties any longer; the old way of “doing up
the housework” made every act an end in itself.
Now every act is simply a means to an end;
every move is important,—the way the dishes are
washed, the beds made, the cooking done, may
win or lose the game. In the child’s mind must
be a perfect plan; to work out that plan correctly
will bring health, order and happiness as the
prize.</p>

<p class='c006'>The world must stop trying to make progress
by walking backward. We must make room for
a vaster scheme of household economics than
the last generation ever dreamed of. The home
must be made to catch up with the factory, the
store and the office, and we know that in comparison
with these industries home-making has
lagged behind. Now—suddenly—we realize that
feeble-minded children are becoming more numerous,
that malnutrition in school children is becoming
so great that the highest standard of
study is impossible and that street life is taking
the place of home life. We wake up and ask
what we can do to make the home-maker realize
that she is responsible for these things.</p>

<p class='c006'>But is she?</p>

<p class='c006'>Educators who admit that life and health are
absolutely dependent on the home have failed to
find room in the educational scheme to provide
this home knowledge. There were in the
elementary schools in New York city last
year 388,000 girls. Only 43,500 of them were
in cooking classes. That means that 344,500
girls in this one year never had a suggestion
given them that home-making was a profession
worth studying. Only seventh and eighth grade
girls are permitted to have cooking lessons, and
that means that during the entire grammar school
course a few fortunate girls received nine full
days of domestic science instruction. I say a few,
for out of 560 elementary schools only 170 are
equipped for cooking; and for these 170 schools,
there are only 135 domestic science teachers—some
cooking rooms are closed altogether and
others running on half time. A girl is fortunate
if she happens not to be in one of the 390 schools
where no instruction in domestic science is given,
and still more fortunate if she stays in one of
the few selected schools until she reaches the
seventh grade. There she first learns that home-making
is worth studying. But 20,000 left school
last year before this grade was reached.</p>

<p class='c006'>Our public school children may be cash girls,
or sales women, or factory hands. These things
may or may not be; but one thing is certain, and
that is that every girl must live in a home and
take her part in home responsibilities.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_033.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>A MODEL FLAT<br>  <br>  The little children of the neighborhood come in to play before lesson time.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The New York board of education would be
the first to admit that it is the home more than
anything else that gives, to children health or
feebleness, life or death, happiness or wretchedness
and yet they and we calmly let this neglect
go on.</p>

<p class='c006'>The school lunch committee made an investigation
a short time ago to ascertain whether malnutrition
was as great an evil as we feared.
Two thousand and fifty-one children were thoroughly
examined. Half of these from an Irish
neighborhood, half from an Italian. They were
selected at random from the four lower grades.
Two hundred and eighty-three or 13 per cent
were found to be suffering from pronounced malnutrition.
Their homes were visited. With the
exception of eighteen tea and coffee was a part
of the daily diet. Sixty families had no prepared
luncheon or dinner at home. One hundred
and fifty-seven were supplying the wrong or insufficient
food and it was found to be more ignorance
than poverty that was the cause of this
condition.</p>

<p class='c006'>If we take 13 per cent of 388,000 children we
have 29,846 poorly nourished girls who are not
even taught that the heavy, dull, sick feeling is
due to the wrong kind of food. How can we
place other knowledge ahead of this? When we
watch this large, half fed army of children marching
on to take up a woman’s battle with life it
does seem as if we had been asleep to our responsibilities.</p>

<p class='c006'>We must establish an adequate twentieth century
theory of household economics and then we
must put this within the reach of every girl in
our public schools.</p>

<p class='c006'>My desk is covered always with pamphlets entitled
The Profession of Home-making, Food
Values, Freehand Cooking on Scientific Principles,
and so on, but does this knowledge reach
the people? Does it reach the 388,000 school
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>girls? Recently I heard an hour’s talk by a member
of the Board of Health on how we ought to
know good milk from bad, how careful we should
be about canned vegetables, and the horrors of
buying tainted meat: but when I asked how the
common people could know these facts I could
get no satisfaction other than that the way to
know whether the milk was good or not was to
examine the barns where the cows were milked
or have the milk tested; but the people I know are
ignorant as to how to wash milk bottles, or why
it is wrong to leave the milk uncovered, or why
the nipple from the milk bottle can’t be played
with, fall on the floor and then be used. This representative
from the Board of Health told startling
facts about candies and ice cream, sold on
push carts, but the audience at this lecture were
land owners along the Hudson River, and I doubt
if one of them had ever seen an East Side push
cart, and I know that not one was ever tempted
to buy. Why can’t these facts reach the thousands
of children who do buy dyed ice cream and
varnished candy, and whose fathers sell these
very things?</p>

<p>A COOKING LESSON</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>We not only have to establish an up-to-date,
scientific way to live, but we cannot do this
without the help of the tenement house woman.
We contribute the ideals, the theories and the
science; she must contribute experience. We are
up in the air with our castles, she is down in the
thick of the fight where the smallness of the tenement
room presses upon her, where every day
she faces the high price of food and an insufficient
income, where a gentle love for her children
is constantly at war with a nervous irritability,
the product of disorder, noise and confusion.</p>

<p class='c006'>Do you think this woman does not want a real
home? Look at the energy and thought she puts
into furnishing her house, the scrimping that preceded
the buying of the ugly red carpet and the
plush chairs. There were hours of work given
to hemming and hanging the ruffles over every
door, around every shelf and even around the
bath tub. Look at the tarletan festooned around
the chandelier and over the pictures; see the
dozens of calendars collected and pinned on the
wall. Isn’t this a reaching out with all the power
that is in a woman to express to her family and
her neighbors what, in her ignorance, she believes
to be a home? We need the energy and the
courage and the experience of these tenement
housekeepers, but we must add education; and
do we?</p>

<p class='c006'>Take the daily life of any one of our thousands
of little school girls and see how much
chance she has to know the science of home-making
or even to acquire respect for housework.
She is born with the controlling desire to copy.
She sees high-heeled shoes on another’s foot;
she longs for and saves until she gets shoes like
them. Her tight skirt, her big hat, her very
walk, are seen first and admired somewhere else,
and so the home, whether it is perfect or imperfect,
and the school, and the teacher, and what
the teacher stands for, make the same vivid pictures
in her mind; and some day she is going to
grow up and copy as nearly as she can.</p>

<p class='c006'>This little girl wakes in the morning in one of
our crowded tenement houses, wakes to the vivid
blue walls, to rooms filled with feather beds
which have been thrown all over the floor the
night before for the family and the possible
boarders to occupy. The dusty carpets, stuffed
furniture, long lace curtains and draped mantle
meet her eye, and in this home of unrest there is
always the crying baby, the naturally cross father
and the demand (so well known to every
little girl) to hurry up and go to the store and
buy breakfast. Poor little tenement girl, she
does not even know that in well-managed homes
breakfast is bought the day before. She may
learn to respect the energy in her home, but she
will never forget the disorder, the picture of congestion
and confusion and of overwrought, tired
nerves that has been stamped forever upon her
mind. And no right idea of home is given her to
correct this wrong impression.</p>

<p class='c006'>Everyone knows the way work is done in our
tenement homes; how the beds are so large that
it is impossible to move them out in the small
rooms and make them properly, and how the bed
clothes are pushed across, often with a broom
handle kept for the purpose; how often the small
income makes it necessary to rent out the beds
in the day time to night workers, so they are always
occupied and never aired. And every one
knows how all these things make a girl lose respect
for her home, then for her family and, finally,
for herself; and how the street seems a
peaceful place in comparison.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Ideals of right home-making should in the
school correct the home mistakes, but as it is
now, not until she reaches the seventh grade
does this little tenement girl get her first idea that
making a home is a part of education. After she
leaves home in the morning she gets only a picture
of a schoolroom with forty or fifty desks;
of a teacher who in no way is associated in her
mind with any house, who, as I heard Mrs. Kelley
say not long ago, often brings her lunch in a
music roll so that no one will suspect that it is
food.</p>

<p class='c006'>The windows in the schoolroom are washed
after school hours (and at that only once or
twice a year) by the janitor, the floors are swept
by men, swept badly, and always after school.
And if this pupil happens to be one of the
twenty thousand who leave school each year before
reaching the seventh grade, she goes into
business not knowing that there is such a thing
as scientific knowledge regarding food and air
and sun and cleanliness.</p>

<p class='c006'>And yet this girl is going to marry, bear children
and rear them, and you and I are going to
hold her responsible if those children are not
good citizens. Surely this is not a fair placing
of responsibility.</p>

<p class='c006'>Eleven years ago I started the first housekeeping
center in New York. These centers are ordinary
tenement flats which find their motive
power and are successful by means of the universal
love in every little girl to play at keeping
house, and the universal desire in every one to
copy that which is just above her.</p>

<p class='c006'>A girl wants her kitchen messes, her dishes,
her make-believe baby and her tiny bed or broom
just as every boy wants his bat and ball. A housekeeping
center takes these natural desires and cultivates
them. It is furnished as a home should
be furnished, and such questions are answered
there as: What shall be done with the floors to
insure health and save labor; what with the
walls? What curtains are the best to admit light,
give beauty to the room and wash easily? What
proportion of the sum laid aside for furnishing
should go into the buying of pots and pans, what
part into mattresses, and is there any reason
to spend money for ruffles? What are the proper
and necessary tools to work with?</p>

<p class='c006'>In the housekeeping center the neighbors and
the scientifically trained teacher work out these
problems together. The teacher’s training in
chemistry has taught her that a certain quality
of water and a certain kind of soap are necessary
for perfect laundry work. The tenement
house woman adds what she has learned from bitter
experience; that it is hard to heat enough of
any kind of water on the stove with coal at ten
cents a pail and the stove crowded with pots and
pans.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_035.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>A LESSON IN BED-MAKING</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Regular lessons are given in these housekeeping
centers morning, afternoon and evening,
and as the flat is like the home from which the
pupils come (only perfected) its lesson is not dissociated
with the daily home duties but is performed
under home conditions and, therefore,
easy of imitation. Do the pupils want this instruction?
The answer is that every class is full
and there is a waiting list, and every girl pays
for the lessons.</p>

<p class='c006'>I find it often difficult in selling luncheons in
the public schools to persuade the children to give
up three cents for a full meal, and yet the children
under fourteen in the housekeeping centers
are ready always to pay three cents a lesson, and
the working girls five cents. And what do they
pay for? To learn to clean the sink so that the
pipes will not get clogged, to learn to cook substitutes
for meat (for meat is too high for many
of them), to scrub closets and floors, to make
and clean beds. Only last week a class of working
girls came to one of the centers and asked
for a bedbug lesson. “The people above us are
moving out” they said, “and we want to prevent
the bugs getting into our house.” A bedbug lesson
is not a lecture, it means to roll up one’s
sleeves, put on a big apron, get on your knees and
scrub, this after working hard all day in a factory
or shop. The desire for this knowledge must
be very real to make a girl willing to do this extra
labor, and to pay for the privilege of doing
it out of her scanty wages.</p>

<p class='c006'>In a housekeeping center it is easy and natural
to borrow a baby from the neighbor across the
hall when the lesson is “how to bathe and dress
a baby.” There is nothing embarrassing about
being the patient when the lesson is “how to give
a bath in bed and how to change the sheets without
disturbing the patient.” Then there are the
dinner classes where the pupils make out the
menu, do the marketing and cook the meat, and
there are lessons in food values.</p>

<p class='c006'>What I feel that we need today is a housekeeping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>center in every settlement, so that every
girl who is a part of the settlement will feel it
almost compulsory upon her to take the course
before she marries, and if she is enjoying the intellectual
life of the settlement, or the play side,
or the social side, she must be learning the home-making
side too. We must make our settlement
girl feel that the home-making training is more
important than mere recreation. The public
school will follow the settlement and then, not for
one-ninth of our girls will home-making instruction
be given, but for every one.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_036.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>A KITCHEN-CLEANING LESSON</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Then there will be in every school the cooking-room,
with its individual equipment (necessary,
but nothing in it to suggest the kitchen at home).
Next to this will be the model flat or center, this
to resemble the homes from which the children
come, but furnished on scientific lines. For eight
years every school girl will see this home, this
home made right, and she will work in it. It
will be no smattering of cooking at the end of
the school course,—but in the beginning, when
the love of playing house is strong, then the
training will begin. Even in the lowest school
grade a child could dust her desk with a damp
duster and be told why it should be damp; she
could wash her own cup, if milk is served; learn
to handle dishes carefully; and train the eye to
see things straight and the hand to steadiness.</p>

<p class='c006'>From these small tasks, the children would
graduate to larger duties in the housekeeping
center; making beds and washing many dishes.
From dusting one desk, the pupil would soon be
able to give the flat a thorough cleaning. We
find in our center that the love of playing house
disappears if it is not cultivated, and the girl
of fourteen never drops entirely the wrong way
of doing housework, which she need never have
acquired if the domestic science teacher could
be in her training early enough.</p>

<p class='c006'>Scientific management means more than “having
system.” You may be ever so systematic
in the way you do things, but if you happen to
be doing them the wrong way, you are doing
the way that is unnecessarily expensive in time,
energy, money, comfort and beauty.</p>

<p class='c006'>I believe that the labor in the kitchen will become
more and more professionalized. It is too
serious a work to be handled by unskilled hands,
and we must lose the nervous, irritable, overtired
slave of housework and make woman more
of a child-trainer and cheerful home-maker. She
must guide her home with the quiet and skill and
delight with which the engineer drives his engine
or the chauffeur his car. This, some day, will
be brought about by centralizing the work and
by an army of trained workers who will expeditiously
and noiselessly do a large part of what
each woman is now trying to do herself. But
that day can come only when women through
universal home-making education push forward
and demand this better management of the home.</p>

<p class='c006'>We must have restlessness and dissatisfaction
first. This comes from a realization of the right
way and a disgust with the wrong way, and then
will come the push from the home-maker herself,
not from a few outside reformers. The
tenement house occupant now is too ready to accept
the fallen plaster, the dish-water that leaks
through from the flat above and the dirty and
dark halls. Her own senses are dull and she
does not see or think about these things, and the
tenement house reformer sometimes feels his
work has been accomplished by a few bath tubs
and a little more light, and then wonders at the
indifference with which these gifts are received
and blames the abuse of them. Train a girl to
know a home of order from one of unrest. Teach
a woman to be miserable at the thought of a
close room or an unaired bed for her baby, and
the social worker can go off and do something
else. The power of action is where it ought to
be, in the awakened tenement house mother. She
will not be content to crowd her family into dark
rooms; she will work until she gets space enough
and light enough for her children. She will be
driven to action because she knows the value of
what she has to fight for. When the suffrage
comes to women, how naturally then these intelligent,
orderly home-makers will take their part in
municipal housecleaning!</p>

<p class='c006'>Let us not be satisfied to force through bills
at Albany that improve our tenements; at the
same time the tenement girl must be receiving
her scientific home training, so that she too, can
take her part in this great home-making profession.</p>

’Tis before daybreak, the streets are mute, whither,

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>Thus, ten year before vice commissions
began to probe into the connection
between white slavery and
low pay, wrote Morris Rosenfeld, the Yiddish
poet. In March the fiftieth anniversary
of his birth was celebrated in Carnegie
Hall by a great gathering of the Jewish
East Side, under the auspices of the
Jewish <cite>Daily Forwards</cite>, to which he is a
contributor.</p>

<p class='c006'>Morris Rosenfeld, as a boy a fisherman
on the shores of a Polish lake, early an
emigrant from home, and until his health
broke down a few years ago a worker in
the sweatshops of London and New York,
expresses in verse the cry of suffering from
persecuted and broken Jew and from exploited
and broken worker.</p>

<p class='c006'>He is no pitiful East Sider struggling for expression,
“found” by a Harvard scholar. He
is a poet offering no halting rhymes for which
apologies are necessary. Yiddish literature
has many poets of real genius, but the major
part of Rosenfeld’s verse alone, in his Songs
from the Ghetto, has been presented to us in
English prose, in the translation of Leo Wiener,
instructor in Slavonic literature in Harvard.</p>

<p class='c006'>Through the medium of a language in which,
in the expression of Mr. Wiener, German, Polish,
Russian and English—the tongues of all
countries through which the Jew has passed—contend
with Hebrew for the possession of each
word, Rosenfeld expresses his meaning with the
note of inevitableness and the adaptation of form
to thought that is seen only in the work of a
great poet.</p>

<p>MORRIS ROSENFELD<br>  <br>  <i>From an etching by Herman Struck</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>His poems are cries of pain out of his own
life interpreted in terms of the life of his class.
He is always lyric, he is always personal, but
he is never egotistical. The story runs that at
his machine in the midday hour he would write
a lyric of the workshop instead of eating his
meager lunch. The song to the working-girl
prostitute is one of these workshop poems which
like a flash reveal working and living conditions
such as in less revealing form have been
put before us by investigators.</p>

<p class='c006'>The twelve-hour day may be said to be the
subject of My Boy. The tailor’s baby was always
asleep when his father got home from
work:</p>

<h3 class='c019'>MY BOY</h3>

<p class='c010'>I have a little boy, a fine little fellow is he! When
I see him it appears to me the whole world is mine.</p>

<p class='c016'>Only rarely, rarely I see him, my pretty little son,
when he is awake; I find him always asleep, I see him
only at night.</p>

<p class='c016'>My work drives me out early and brings me home
late; oh, my own flesh is a stranger to me; oh, strange
to me the glances of my child!</p>

<p class='c016'>I come home in anguish and shrouded in darkness—my
pale wife tells how nicely the child plays.</p>

<div class='nf-center c018'>
    <div>I stand by the cradle.</div>
  </div>

<p class='c016'>I stand in pain and anguish and bitterness, and I

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>
  <h3 class='c019'>DESPAIR</h3>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Is it not allowed to rest even one day in the week
and to be at least one day free from the angry growl
of the boss, his gloomy mien, his terrible looks; to
forget the shop and the cries of the foreman; to forget
slavery, to forget woe? You wish to forget yourself
and be rested? Never mind, you will soon go to your
rest!</p>

<p class='c016'>Soon the trees and flowers will have withered; the
last bird is already ending his song; soon there will be
cemeteries all around! Oh, how I should like to smell
a flower and feel, before the grass is dead, the breath
of zephyr in the green fields! You wish to be in the
fields where it is airy and green? Never mind you will
be carried there soon enough!</p>

<p class='c016'>The brook is silvery and glistens beautifully; the
waves are covered with a heavenly grace. Oh, how good
it is to bathe there! How I should enjoy leaping into
it! My body is weakened from the dreadful work,—how
they both would refresh me! Oh, you wish to make your
ablution in the brooks? Be not frightened, you will
soon receive your ablution!</p>

<p class='c016'>The sweatshop is dark and smoky and small. How
can my white blouse be clean there? In the dirty shop
cleanliness is unknown to me. How a pure white shirt
adorns a man! How proper for a noble body it is, in
order to be free to work humanely and be clean withal!
You wish now to dress yourself in white? They will
dress you, and dress you quickly enough!</p>

<p class='c016'>The woods are breezy, in the woods it is cool. How
good to dream there quietly! The little birds sing
pleasantly; but in the shop there is noise, and the air
is suffocating! Oh, you wish to be cool?</p>

<p class='c016'>Of what avail is a forest to you? It will not be
long before you will be cold.</p>

<p class='c016'>’Tis good to have a dear companion. In adversity he
gives hope, in misery—courage. A dear companion
sweetens your being, and he gives you a zest for life.
And I am orphaned alone like a stone, there are no
companions, I am all by myself—you will soon have
companions without end; they swarm already and are
waiting for you!</p>

<p class='c011'>The Pale Operator gives a hint of the ravages
of tuberculosis in the garment trade:</p>

<h3 class='c019'>THE PALE OPERATOR</h3>

<p class='c010'>I see there a pale operator all absorbed in his work.
Ever since I remember him, he has been sewing and
using up his strength.</p>

<p class='c016'>Months fly, and years pass away, and the pale faced
one still bends over his work and struggles with the
unfeeling machine.</p>

<p class='c016'>I stand and look at his face; his face is besmutted
and covered with sweat. I feel that it is not bodily
strength that works in him but the incitement of the
spirit.</p>

<p class='c016'>And the tears fall in succession from day break until
fall of night and water the clothes and enter into the
seams.</p>

<p class='c016'>Pray how long will the weak one drive the bloody
wheel? Who can tell his end? Who knows the terrible
secret?</p>

<p class='c016'>Hard, very hard to answer that! But one thing is
certain: when the work will have killed him another will
be sitting in his place and sewing.</p>

<p class='c011'>A desire for life—if it is a feast, he would
sit at it; if it is a dream he would have it a
beautiful one—a love of the outdoor country
life which he knew as a boy and which he believed
all should enjoy, mingled with a sense of
impotence and despair, varying with outbursts of
wailing and outbursts of hate, these things characterize
the poetry of Morris Rosenfeld. For
all his power to vizualize and voice the world
about him, he is never constructive, never militant,
and seldom even virile.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c005'><sup>[6]</sup></a> In few poems does
he express any hope for the future. In a mood
of despair he writes the beautiful workshop
poem:</p>

<h3 class='c019'>A TEAR ON THE IRON</h3>

<div class='lg-container-b c017'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>I groan and cough and press, and think</div>
      <div class='line'>My eye grows damp, a tear falls; the iron is hot,</div>
      <div class='line'>My little tear it seethes and seethes and will not dry up.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>I feel no strength, it is all used up; the iron falls
from my hand, and yet the tear, the silent tear, the
tear, the tear boils more and more.</p>

<p class='c016'>My head whirls, my heart breaks. I ask in woe:
“Oh, tell me, my friend in adversity and pain, O tear,
why not dry up in seething.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Are you perhaps a messenger and announce that other
tears are coming? I should like to know it; say, when
will the great woe be ended?”</p>

<p class='c016'>I should have asked more of the turbulent tear; but
suddenly there began to flow more tears, tears without
measure, and I at once understood that the river of
tears is very deep.</p>

<p class='c011'>In a mood of mingled longing and hate, he
writes the Flowers of Autumn, whose splendor
is only for the well-to-do—</p>

<p class='c010'>Therefore I do not care if I see you dying now.</p>

<p class='c011'>There is more virility, though nothing really
purposeful in the Garden of the Dead, where
the dead worker rises up to claim the flowers on
the rich man’s grave:</p>

<p class='c010'>Not only the flowers are mine, nay, even the boards
of the coffin are mine!</p>

<p class='c016'>And not only the boards of the coffin—you shrouds,
you, too, are mine! He has it all through my work,
my poor work—oh, all and all is mine!</p>

<p class='c016'>Then the dead one passed away in the air with cries:</p>

<p class='c016'>“You will pay for it yet! And he clenched his fist and
threatened the world.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The poet’s love for nature, the human longing
of the worker imprisoned in the city for the
country, which he has known but which is now
beyond his reach, is expressed in the nightingale’s
challenge to the laborer:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Summer is here, summer is here! I shall not sing to
you eternally, for finally my hour too will strike—a
dark crow will occupy my branch, the holy song will
cease. How long must I sing to you from the tree of
the golden dream of freedom and love? Rise and let
me not urge you any longer! The heaven will not
remain eternally blue! Summer is here, summer is
here! Now one can pass a merry time, for just like
you who are fading at your machine, everything will
in the end wither and be carried away.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Nightingale illustrates, as Professor
Wiener points out, the poet’s command over
poetic form as well as poetic thought. Even
in the English prose translation we can feel the
repetition of notes, the intricate weaving of
melody in the bird’s song.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another poem which is an example of the same
power of combining matter and manner is that
drama of the garment worker’s lift, The Sweatshop,
which deserves to be quoted in full:</p>

<h3 class='c019'>THE SWEAT SHOP</h3>

<p class='c010'>The machines in the shop roar so wildly that often
I forget in the roar that I am; I am lost in the
terrible tumult, my ego disappears, I am a machine.
I work and work and work without end. I am busy
and busy and busy at all time. For what and for
when? I know not, I ask not! How should a machine
ever come to think?</p>

<p class='c016'>There are no feelings, no thoughts, no reason; the
bitter bloody work kills the noblest, the most beautiful
and best, the richest, the deepest, the highest, which
life possesses. The seconds, minutes and hours fly; the
nights like the days pass as swiftly as sails; I drive
the machine just as if I wished to catch them; I chase
without avail, I chase without end.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>The clock in the workshop does not rest; it keeps on
pointing and ticking and waking in succession. A man
once told me the meaning of its pointing and waking—that
there was a reason in it; as if through a dream
I remember it all; the clock awakens life and sense in
me, and something else—I forget what; ask me not,
I know not, I know not, I am a machine!</p>

<p class='c016'>And at times, when I hear the clock, I understand
quite differently its pointing, its language; it seems to
me as if the unrest<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c005'><sup>[7]</sup></a> egged me on so that I should work
more, more, much more. In its sound I hear only the
angry words of the boss; in the two hands I see his
gloomy look. The clock, I shudder—it seems to me it
drives me and calls me machine, and cries out to me
“sew”!</p>

<p class='c016'>Only when the wild tumult subsides, and the master
is away for the midday hour, day begins to dawn in
my head, and a pain passes through my heart; I feel
my wound, and bitter tears and boiling tears wet my
meager meal, my bread; it chokes me, I can eat no
more, I cannot! O, horrible toil! O, bitter necessity.</p>

<p class='c016'>The shop at the midday hour appears to me like a
bloody battlefield where all are at rest; about me I
see lying the dead, and the blood that has been spilled
cries from the earth. A minute later—the tocsin is
sounded, the dead arise, the battle is renewed. The
corpses fight for strangers, for strangers, and they battle
and fall and disappear into night.</p>

<p class='c016'>I look at the battlefield in bitter anger, in terror,
with a feeling of revenge, with a hellish pain. The
clock now I hear it aright. It is calling: “An end to
slavery, an end shall it be”! It vivifies my reason, my
feelings and shows how the hours fly; miserable I shall
be as long as I am silent, lost, as long as I remain
what I am.</p>

<p class='c016'>The man that sleeps in me begins to waken—the slave
that wakens in me is put to sleep. Now the right hour
has come, an end to misery, an end let it be! But
suddenly—the whistle, the boss, an alarm! I lose my
reason, forget where I am; there is a tumult, the battle.
Oh, my ego is lost! I know not, I care not, I am a
machine!</p>

<p class='c011'>The prose translation reproduces the thought
alone; the Yiddish original reproduces also the
loud insistent stitching of the machines, and the
persistent nagging of the hateful clock. The
machine beats out these lines:</p>

<p class='c010'>Ich arbeit, un’ arbeit, un’ arbeit ohn’ Cheschben.</p>

<p class='c016'>Es schafft sich, un schafft sich, un schafft sich ohn’
Zahl.<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c005'><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c011'>To what he feels to be the hopeless tragedy
of the worker is added in Rosenfeld’s verse the
hopeless tragedy of the Jew—the wanderer who
has lost the power to laugh. In Sephira<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c005'><sup>[9]</sup></a> as well
as in other poems, he brings out the fact that
the Jew has set his Passover and the period of
mourning following it, in the happiest time of
the year. This poem, which has been really adequately
translated into verse by Alice Stone
Blackwell, is one of his saddest and most beautiful:</p>

<p class='c006'>For the Rosenfeld of the Songs from the Ghetto,
the present is terrible and the future hopeless;
there is always an aching desire for beauty and
happiness, but to him beauty and happiness themselves
wait upon toil and suffering and death—the
nightingale groans “upon the great cemetery
of the world.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But Songs from the Ghetto was written some
fifteen years ago. Some of his later poetry is
lighter—some hope and the joy of living appear
to have crept into it. Of these, a hitherto unpublished
poem in English called “If,” has but a
gentle melancholy:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div>THE WORK OF ABASTENIA ST. LEGER EBERLE</div>
    <div class='c009'>CHRISTINA MERRIMAN</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>The recent International Exhibition of Art
in New York was, from one angle, at
least, a protest against certain set standards
of art generally accepted today as inevitably
right because they have “always been.”
Some of the by-products of that stimulating
movement toward freedom have been variously
characterized as “courageous” “self-expressive”
and “insolent.” Certainly much of it was a
serious effort toward individual expression—a
revolt against academic rules—partaking in some
instances of a defiance which was a law unto
itself, a frank disregard of what impression the
mystified public carried away.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such, however, was not the attitude or feeling
of at least one exhibitor whose work aroused
much interest and comment, and who was one of
the first artists of standing to reflect in her work
the spirit of awakened social consciousness
so apparent today. Abastenia St. Leger
Eberle showed two groups, the more striking of
which was The White Slave, reproduced on the
cover of this issue of <span class='sc'>The Survey</span>. They are
the work of a sculptor who has strongly defined
views as to the part the artist should play in the
common life.</p>

<p class='c006'>“The artist should be <i>the</i> ‘socialist,’” says Miss
Eberle. “He has no right to work as an individualist
without responsibility to others. He is
the specialized eye of society, just as the artisan
is the hand, and the thinker the brain. More
than almost any other one sort of work is art
dependent on society for inspiration, material,
life itself; and in that same measure does it owe
society a debt. The artist must see for the people—reveal
them to themselves and to each
other.”</p>

<p class='c006'>This is a far cry from “art for art’s sake.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>That it is the viewpoint of an artist of
high standing is attested by the early
and generous recognition accorded Miss
Eberle’s work from conservative and radical
alike.</p>

<p class='c006'>Most of her training was received from
George Gray Barnard, with whom she studied
for three years. In 1904, she was awarded a
bronze medal at the St. Louis Exposition; the
Girl on Roller Skate was purchased by the
Metropolitan Museum in 1907; the Windy Doorstep
was awarded the Helen Foster Barnett prize
at the exhibit of the New York Academy in 1910;
her figure of the veiled Salome was bought by
an Italian Art Society in Venice; and she is
one of the ten women who belong to the National
Sculpture Society.</p>

<p class='c006'>Miss Eberle is best known, perhaps, for her
dancing figures, and her depiction of the everyday
picturesque life on the lower East Side in
New York, where she lived for years. Her people
live for us, and speak for themselves,—from the
placid, necessitous hunt of the Rag Picker to
the tremulous wistfulness of the loving Little
Mother; from the tender feeling of The Bath
Hour to the intense, joyous absorption of the
Rag-time dancer and the exultant balance of
that flying little figure on the Roller Skate—and
please notice that, characteristically, there
is only one—borrowed, no doubt for a precious
three-minute “coast.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_041a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE WINDY DOORSTEP</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The qualities which art critics first look for—the
sure touch and line of her modelling, the line
composition and massing—are especially apparent
in The Windy Doorstep, in which Miss Eberle
touches the high-water mark of her more objective
figures.</p>

<p class='c006'>Here it will be more interesting to note the
steps by which social values have crept into
her work.</p>

<p class='c006'>First of all, her deep and instinctive love for
children, and her appreciation of human values,
led her to select types that until recently have
been almost entirely disregarded.</p>

<p class='c006'>To this keen observer and lover of human nature,
the many years of contact with this vivid,
arduous East Side life—reinforced and interpreted
by constant reading and thinking—brought
an ever-increasing sense of social interrelation
and interdependence. Jane Addams’ books
have, more than anything else, she says, helped
to clarify and mould her vision of the constructive
part the sculptor may play in social readjustment.</p>

<p class='c006'>This growth of social consciousness has been
reflected in her work.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id001'>
<img src='images/i_041b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p>THE LITTLE MOTHER</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Just as The Windy Doorstep, with its fine feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>for the dignity of everyday homely tasks,
outranks the Roller Skater which, she says, was
done in a purely objective spirit, so the White
Slave records a forward step which is a difference
of kind even more than degree.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id004'>
<img src='images/i_042.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>THE RAG PICKER</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Here she has turned from her more objective
work to the graphic interpretation of a social
menace; and it is here, perhaps, that she
finds herself with surest touch. Her conception
of white slavery is as searching in its indictment,
as ruthless, cruel and scourging as the
fact itself. One visitor who saw those haunting
figures at the International Exhibition said afterward:</p>

<p class='c006'>“I was passing through that room of the exhibit
when suddenly I faced it—I could not go
on. I had vaguely realized that this horrible
thing was in the world, but it had never touched
<i>me</i>. I sat there for perhaps an hour, thinking—and
thinking—”</p>

<p class='c006'>This woman was one who has led what is
called a “sheltered” existence, whose instinct
would be to turn from any discussion or writing
on this subject. It is this thought-compelling
quality in such work which links it as a social
force with, say, the dispassionate but terrible report
of the Chicago Vice Commission, or with
Elizabeth Robins’ My Little Sister.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is interesting to know that Miss Eberle
worked out the composition for the White Slave
four years ago; but the actual work of modelling
was done in the four weeks’ interval between
the time she was invited to send some of her
work to last winter’s International Art Exhibition
and its opening. Until then, she had felt
that the time had perhaps not come when such
a group would be received except as an unwelcome
effort toward sensationalism. It is the first
of several such interpretative subjects which she
has in mind, and which, if worked out in an
equally sincere spirit, should be big in social
significance.</p>

<p class='c006'>But after all is said, Miss Eberle consistently
holds with the many who believe that the first
function of art is not didactic. Much of her
work besides that shown here is conceived in a
spirit of sheer joy in beauty of form and line,
and one may go far to find a more exquisitely
modelled figure than that of the utterly submissive,
despairful child-victim of the white
slaver. To use her own words:</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is the beauty that is in the world <i>today</i>
that appeals to me—not what may have existed
centuries ago in Greece. Though I love that,
too, I will not shut my eyes to the present and
continue to echo the past. No matter how ugly
the present might be, I would rather live in it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>After all, ugliness, as well as beauty is in the
eyes of the beholder,—and the present <i>isn’t</i> ugly
at all, but full of a wonderful interest, as a few
of us are beginning to find out. We are trying
to find new bottles for new wine—Greek vases
are about worn out.”</p>

<div class='ic002'>
<p><i>THE BATH HOUR</i></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>And so we may, as she asks, leave her work
to make its own eloquent plea for what Emerson
calls “the eternal picture that nature paints in
the street, with moving men and children, beggars
and fine ladies,&#160;... capped and based
by heaven, earth and sea.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>In My Little Sister<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c005'><sup>[10]</sup></a> Elizabeth Robins has
let us hear a great cry out of the depths—an
actual human cry.</p>

<p class='c006'>True, many snug, comfortable people, shaken
for a moment out of their apathy, dismiss it all
carelessly, even contemptuously. Many who are
gripped to the heart as they read brush away the
tears with a sign of relief and say, “Well, it’s only
a story.” But what a “story!”</p>

<p class='c006'>It is told in a tense, staccato style which hurries
the reader on—on even through the idealistic
descriptions of the English country and
the stretching moor, across which, in its little
garden planted by loving hands, stands the “dear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>home” of the officer’s gentle widow and her two
daughters, the Elder Sister in whose words the
story is told and whose name is never mentioned,
and the Little Sister, Bettina, all golden and
bright, a creature so touchingly exquisite, so
like a flower.</p>

<p class='c006'>Through the sweet, lightly sketched scenes of
the childhood, girlhood and dawning womanhood
of these two fair young creatures there is woven
a dark thread of fear, dread, tragedy. Some
experience of brutality this dainty, tenderly devoted
mother has had, an experience which is
never more than darkly hinted at. She forgets
the terror of it only in those happy memories
that cluster about her lover-husband. His body
was brought home to her from a fatal tiger hunt.
Her only consolation in his loss, she tells the
Elder Sister, was that she knew that there are
worse dangers than those of the jungle! She
had the joy of knowing that he died while all
was “bright and untarnished.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The narrative hastens on, always with a hovering
sense of doom. The innocent, tender love
stories of the sisters develop. They are but
seventeen and nineteen, but they are women. It
is impossible to do justice to the telling of this
story, so we will pass to the main event, the invitation
of the London aunt, the failing health
and fortune of the mother, which nerves her
to accept an offer that will separate her from
her children, and the almost happy bustle of
preparation for the first visit from home, and
for that wonder of wonders—a London season!
The sinister part played by Madame Aurore, the
little London dressmaker who, while working for
them in their country home lays the plans that
are to decoy them to their ruin in London, is
worked out with sure, rapid touch. Then comes
the arrival in London, the meeting of the girls
by the pseudo “aunt,” who has been dressed for
the part by the aid of a photograph sent on to
the procurers by Madame Aurore. Then follows
the terrible scene in the house with the
barred windows and the strange overwhelming
scent, the escape of the Elder Sister, the heart-breaking
search for the younger—the madness,
the despair! One of the most pathetic things
in the book is the heart-broken young lover
who traces Bettina from London to “their house
in Paris”—thence from one place to another “always
too late.” The merciful death of the
mother, and the fixed conviction, the subliminal
inspiration, that comes toward the end to the
tortured brain of the elder sister that Bettina
has found her release in death, alleviate and
spiritualize the misery of it all.</p>

<p class='c006'>Now as to the truth of this tremendous story.
I suppose that having put the very soul of truth
and reality into the narrative itself, having written
it from the very depths of her own pitying
heart, the author has not reckoned with the
callous incredulity which the book often meets,
or she might well have added an introductory
note in regard to the actual facts in this case
from real life. The story, she told me subsequent
to its publication, was absolutely true, but
much softened at many points. In the true
story, for instance, the mother is not dead, but
is in a state of dementia on the continent,
whither the family have moved, being unable
to endure England and its memories.</p>

<p class='c006'>Moreover, although Miss Robins’ experience
in working for women and the woman’s cause
in England had brought to her knowledge many
life histories more unspeakable than this, after
she had finished this book she said to herself,
“Now here is a story that I know to be absolutely
true, but how valuable is it to give to the
world an individual instance of this kind; how
far can it be generalized?” To test this she
went, with that sincerity of spirit that characterizes
all she does, to a noted police justice in London
and laid the story before him, asking him
what he would do if a person came to him with
such a story. He answered sadly, with no show
of being at all roused by anything unusual, that
he would begin to take evidence immediately
and see what he could do about it. He added
that the story was really a commonplace.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such is the reticence of the English press, and
such is the stern family pride concerning the
“blot on the scutcheon,” and all those traditions
which grow out of the double moral standard
whereby the escapade of the son of the house
can even be repeated lightly while the slightest
shadow on the name of the daughter is an unspeakable
disgrace, that no one knows how many
tragedies of this kind are hidden from sight in
the records of numerous respectable families.</p>

<p class='c006'>To satisfy herself more completely that the
story was susceptible of extensive application,
Miss Robins took it to several London police
inspectors. No one for a moment stopped to
doubt or question the facts. The most horrible
stories that the human mind can conceive are
old stories to them. When the Home Secretary
was asked a question on this subject in the
House of Commons only a few weeks ago, he
answered that in London city alone, to his knowledge,
there had been reported fifty-three girls
lost and never heard of within a few months.
Such facts as this explain the tragic intensity
with which the book is written.</p>

<p class='c006'>Danger! Danger! Danger! That is the dominant
note that sounds throughout the narrative.
How pathetically the mother’s poignant
fears contrast with her ineffectiveness. Ever
this haunting danger, whether mother and daughters
are walking in the sunset, or planting in
the garden, or sitting by the hearth. What a
wonderful picture Miss Robins gives of the
mother’s desperate dependence on the four walls
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>of her home—“Soon home, now, little girl, soon
safe in our dear home.” The danger signal of
the night-bird’s note is introduced with inimitable
art—a subtle suggestion, even in those early
days, of the gray hawk whose shadow hovers
over bright young lives.</p>

<p class='c006'>The unutterable sadness of it all and the stern
warning to mothers that children’s homes are
not just in four walls, but are in towns and cities
and nations! How utterly ineffectual seem an
individual mother’s effort for the safety of her
child. How evident is it that a mother’s care
must have back of it power—power in council
and legislative hall. How strongly the lack of
social sympathy is brought out; the mother’s
indifference to the great crying needs of the
world. This mother’s “place was the home,”
and to what did all her negative efforts avail
in shutting the danger away from her cherished
daughters in a nation, in a world, which holds
a traffic system of such Machiavellian adroitness,
a system which can afford, so great are its
profits, to reach into the inner recesses of a
home, to work with endless patience and resourcefulness
and which can enlist on its side
such power that even the London police, perhaps
the least corrupt in the world, can answer
evasively to the frantic cry, “Do you know such
a house?”—“We have a great many on the list,
but not many such as you describe;” and follow
this statement with the maddening inactivity
which Miss Robins describes with vivid accuracy.</p>

<p class='c006'>Her book is a terrific arraignment of the conditions
which make such a tragedy possible. Respectability
and indifference are personified
scathingly in the monumental aunt, deaf to the
world voices of agony. All society is arraigned
as the Elder Sister storms at her aunt, “sitting
massive, calm, with a power of inert resistance.”
Her bewildered answer to the mad cry for help,—“It
isn’t possible, this is England,”—sounds
strangely natural to us. It is the burden of so
many recent New York editorials, “such things
don’t happen”!—and that in our land where the
record of the Chicago Immigration League tells
of 1,700 girls between the railroad terminals of
New York and Chicago alone, reported lost in
one year. Thus wails the Elder Sister,—“So
old and unbelieving, I felt she had looked on
unmoved at evil since the world began....
She rose, O! but slowly;—slow, stiff and ponderous.
I felt in her all the heaviness of acquiescence
since time began.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus is the unbelievable apathy of society
pictured! Thus Miss Robins touches lightly, pitifully
on the problem of a girl’s handicap in the
lack of preparation for life. What a picture she
gives of the sheltered girl—“Such a little thing,
my not knowing how to telephone, yet it might
cost my mother her life.” Again this motive is
sounded when the daughter is begging her mother
for knowledge about her experiences, and the
great gray danger—“It is not the kind of thing
you need ever know,” answers the mother with
fatuous finality.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nor does she make our heart bleed for girlhood
alone, but for manhood, as that blood-curdling
conversation, unparalleled in literature,
is gasped out between the Man and the Elder Sister
as they crouch in the shadow in that ghastly
room in what he himself tells her is “one of the
most terrible houses in Europe.” Here we see
manhood disfigured, draggled beyond recognition,
sitting in the dust and ashes of a charnel
house. How sodden the words fall from his
lips as depraved and perverted manhood defends
itself. “This is a commonplace in the world, in
every capital of every nation on earth. Bishops,
old ladies, imagine you could alter these things.”
“Human nature—human nature,” muses the Elder
Sister, “like the tolling of a muffled bell.”
Thus are the wickedest, most deadly of the
world’s platitudes on this subject uttered in this
glaring scene of abnormality, so that automatically
they are given the lie.</p>

<p class='c006'>The unbelieving will say, “But how is it possible
that we do not hear oftener of such cases?”
Two elements especially conspire to suppress such
knowledge, both based on a false attitude towards
women. First the double standard of morals
which holds men’s purity so much lower than
woman’s; second, the unjust attitude towards
women reflected in the press which is more
likely to seize upon a disappearance story in such
a way as to make it reflect upon the girls’ character
rather than to acknowledge it a possible
case of abduction or white slavery.</p>

<p class='c006'>As I write, Miss Robins sends me letters which
she has recently received from people interested
in her book. One speaking of the “awful traffic
that is going on” tells how two girls, daughters
of a clergyman, have disappeared on their
journey home from school and have never been
heard of since.</p>

<p class='c006'>A letter from Miss Robins herself adds the
following to her remarks on her book. “Of all
the official people I consulted, not one of these
experts doubted my story, <i>and all had known
similar cases</i>. We do not need to be told that
the people to whom these things happen, if they
are refined and sensitive, are not eager to make
known their ruin. The natural impulse is to
cover the horror from every eye, even to deny
it.”</p>

<p class='c006'>“If you will consult the findings of your own
commissions you will see that in America ‘no
girl of any class is safe.’”</p>

<p class='c006'>I myself know at first hand an appalling number
of cases—wives, women of standing, college
girls on journeys, young girls on their way to
boarding school, and working girls trapped and
sold. In Rose Livingston’s mail in the last few
weeks have come heartrending letters from parents
for help in finding their lost daughters. A
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>letter I read yesterday from a doctor’s wife in
Indiana was so terrible in the lingering pathos
with which the mother dwelt on the beauty
and sweetness of this lost daughter that I handed
it back without reading to the end.</p>

<p class='c006'>In connection with Miss Robins’ letter, I offer
the following quotation from a paper by
Stanley Finch of the Federal Department of
Justice where he speaks of the operation of the
Federal White Slave Traffic Act. “The number
of complaints and prosecutions is rapidly increasing....
Such crimes are more numerous
than was first believed possible.... It has
become evident that thousands of people<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c005'><sup>[11]</sup></a> in
practically all parts of the country were violating
the law.... [We found] girls were
being transported in such interstate and foreign
commerce solely for the purpose of prostitution
and were being treated as mere articles of merchandise
for the profit of those who handled
them and who were willing for the profit involved
to sacrifice both the bodies and the souls
of their victims.... As we extend this
work [of federal prosecution] throughout the
country the awful interstate trade in women and
girls for immoral purposes which for years has
been going on almost without let or hindrance,
has now become a very dangerous occupation....
The practices of people engaged in the
white slave traffic involves in a considerable number
of cases the actual physical detention of
women and girls against their will in this vilest
form of involuntary servitude.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Would that there were space to reinforce these
remarks by New York newspaper headlines dealing
with such cases for the month of March
15 to April 15.</p>

<p class='c006'>How many fathers and mothers, brothers and
sisters, friends and lovers throughout this country,
have lived through the agony endured by
the Elder Sister and the lover in Miss Robins’
book? That which had been their greatest care
and burden, the frail health of Bettina, becomes
the Elder Sister’s one comfort and hope. How
many a bereft father and mother today not only
cling in anguish to that hope, but desperately
refuse to believe but that their girl is dead!
And with reliable students estimating the life
of the white slave in this country at five years,
we know that many a flower-like highly organized
Little Sister has met mercifully her release
in a few weeks—a few months.</p>

<p class='c006'>To those who know how considerable a factor
in the whole problem of the white slave traffic is
the girl who is taken, not the girl who goes, the
girl who is under compulsion, not the girl who
stays, this book is a great contribution. <span class='sc'>The
Survey</span> printed some time since a poster that
has been used in this country from ocean to
ocean: “Danger! Mothers, beware! 60,000 innocent
girls wanted to take the place of 60,000
white slaves who will die this year in the United
States.” If My Little Sister will only make the
truth of this warning more real, more individual
more poignant, then, in the pain-soothing words
that close this book, “She will not have suffered
in vain, and others will thank her too.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Such a book is not merely a literary production,
an exquisite work of art: it is a high, sincere
human service. Front a literary point of
view it is a great book. One is reminded of the
Aeschylean definition of tragedy: “That which
purifies the heart through pity and terror.” But
this book not only reaches great tragic and
dramatic heights, but its subtle art is such that
it blends with the tragedy in an almost eerie
way a lyric chord which echoes throughout, an
unbroken strain of hope and pity, of the essential
dignity and sanity and rightness of life.</p>

<div class='nf-center c013'>
    <div>A PLEA FOR A NEW LEGISLATURE TO MAKE AND ENFORCE LAWS AGAINST VICE</div>
    <div class='c009'>A. LEO WEIL</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>[<i>Mr. Weil, one of the best known attorneys of western Pennsylvania, is known
outside of his profession as the militant President of the Pittsburgh Voters’ League,
the organization which exposed the graft scandals of three years ago, sent councilmen
and bankers to jail and brought new and invigorating spirit into Pittsburgh
municipal life. Last Year the Voters’ League successfully brought charges against
the head of the Department of Public Safety, and provoked a situation which led
to the creation of the Pittsburgh Morals Commission, a semi-official body without
governmental authority, and the cleaning-up of the big numbered district.</i></p>

<p class='c012'><i>It is on the basis of this experience that Mr. Weil reaches the conclusions here
set forth. He was a witness before the Wagner commission which has recommended
legislation now pending in New York (with every prospect of passage)
that will create a separate public welfare department, largely divorce it from the
city administration and entrust its commissioners, appointed by the mayor, with
powers with respect to vice somewhat similar to those held by the Board of Health
with respect to sanitary conditions.</i>—Ed.]</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c015'>The police, a body of men selected primarily
to preserve order, protect life, prevent
crime, apprehend the criminal, and perform
other administrative duties—men perhaps
wholly unfitted as a body for anything else—have
been expected to solve, by legislation, problems
which have confounded the wisest from the time
whereof the memory of man runneth not to the
contrary.</p>

<p class='c006'>That the police have failed could not be otherwise.</p>

<p class='c006'>That they have aggravated the evil was to be
expected.</p>

<p class='c006'>That ultimately legislation must be placed in
competent, qualified hands, must be apparent.</p>

<p class='c006'>That it will require the greatest minds, the
best thought, the highest statesmanship, and almost
a divine perception, to apprehend and deal
with those complex, involved, intricate questions
having to do with the passions of men and the
strongest laws of nature, urging defiance of human
laws, seems to be axiomatic.</p>

<p class='c006'>Nevertheless, on the subject of vice as generally
understood in our cities, the police are expected
not only to administer the laws, but to make
them; not only to enforce enactments, but to
frame them. And herein lies, in my judgment,
the root of the evil in present day conditions
which has brought our police into disrepute.</p>

<p class='c006'>All countries, from the most despotic to the
most liberal, from the most conservative to the
most radical, have left this question of the social
evil to the police, and have not dared, through
their legislative bodies, to thoroughly consider and
pass laws to eradicate it. Such meager legislation
as has been passed has been ignored in the
congested centers of population, and generally
such legislation has not been supported by the public
sentiment of those communities. Legislation
has been generally of a merely prohibitive character,
ignoring existing conditions, together with
the army of human beings living upon vice, for
whom some provision must be made.</p>

<p class='c006'>Even if the legislatures could be induced to
take up this question and pass general laws, it
would necessarily follow that such laws in their
generality must look to the future, rather than
to the present, and existing conditions would have
to be left to some other authority.</p>

<p class='c006'>In every large city there are thousands engaged
in prostitution. They can neither be exterminated
by the fiat of law nor reformed by the
passage of proclamations. Public morals, like
private morals, can be improved only gradually.
It is not so much the theoretical question of to be
or not to be, but the practical situation summed
up in such phrases as: It is—it will for a time
remain. The future—what is it to be?</p>

<p class='c006'>Would it not be wise to ask the legislature to
pass a law requiring every city to appoint a body
of men to draft, and from time to time revise, a
code of laws to regulate, suppress, exterminate,
and generally to deal with, this problem of prostitution?
To it must be given authority. It must
be vested with legislative power. It should have
its own employes—call it a morals police force,
if you wilt—to carry into effect the rules, regulations
and laws passed by this commission.
That men could be obtained to act upon such a
commission, public-spirited, representative students
of social questions, I fully believe. No one
would accept a place on such a board who was
not interested in the welfare of his community.
The responsibilities would be fearful; the criticism
would be severe. No one without a blameless
life would dare to act. Whether or not ultimately
the regular police force could be used by
such a commission would be a question of policy.
At any rate, for the present, I believe it would be
unwise.</p>

<p class='c006'>Such a commission would collect data of inestimable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>value, data that was reliable, and of
which there is now none worth while. Such a
commission would doubtless make mistake after
mistake, perhaps would depart from all its preconceived
notions at the start. Nevertheless, it
is reasonable to assume that step by step it would
gradually and slowly work out a solution. Looking
the country over, we see that voluntary organizations
have accomplished temporary good,
but their effort has never been persistent, continuous,
permanent, authoritative, legal.</p>

<p class='c006'>The adoption of the plan suggested would take
out of the hands of those wholly unfitted for so
great an undertaking this momentous question,
and place it in the hands of others who we would
have the right to assume would ultimately be
found to deal with it, so far as human intelligence,
study, observation and experiment can enable
and qualify men to deal with it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Another and a greatly to be desired result
would also be accomplished. It would remove
from the police that which today contaminates
the organization, so that in every city they have
been brought under a suspicion unfortunately too
frequently deserved, an opprobrium too justly applied.</p>

<p class='c006'>The casting of this burden upon the police,
more than any other cause, sows the seed of corruption,
furnishes the opportunity for profit,
brings into alliance the law officers and the law-breakers,
disgraces the police force, and keeps off
of it many men who would otherwise be glad to
serve their communities in a position that should
command the respect and consideration of the
people.</p>

<p class='c006'>This police burden has in turn been the biggest
rock upon which self-government has capsized in
our American cities.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c002'>THE BELGIAN STRIKE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c021'>[<i>The mass strike of the Belgian workers was carried to an issue last week.
The motion of the Liberal member which brought the strike to a close, while it does
not specifically grant the reform asked for by the Socialists, is considered such a lien
on government action as to amount to a victory for them. These interpretations
of the larger significance of the strike from different angles were, of course, written
while the struggle was going on.</i></p>

<p class='c012'><i>Mr. Walling, who is a member of the radical wing of the Socialist party, is a
student of international Socialism, his most recent book being The Larger Aspects of
Socialism. He was in Russia during the Revolution, and knew intimately the details
of the great Russian general strike of 1905.</i>—Ed.]</p>
<h3 class='c019'>I.<br> GRAHAM TAYLOR</h3>
<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>The nation-wide strike for manhood suffrage
in Belgium which paralyzed the
industries and almost suspended the normal
life of the people was foreshadowed in a
spectacular demonstration in Brussels two years
ago.</p>

<p class='c006'>On August 15, 1911, the streets of that gay,
medieval capital witnessed scenes which every
American who looked on knew were making history.
Over 60,000 men, from larger and smaller
places throughout Belgium, took a day off without
wages and paid their way to the capital of
their country, in order to voice their protest
against the unjust inequalities of the suffrage.
The show of force by the extraordinary police
and military precautions betrayed the furtive
apprehension of both the municipal and national
governments as to what might happen. With
no sign of timidity or intimation of being overawed,
this vast industrial army marched ten
abreast for hours—silent, grim, determined,
united, unarmed—between long files of armed
soldiery which lined the curbs, and past
stronger detachments of all arms of the service
massed at strategic centers.</p>

<p class='c006'>The great procession assembled at the Socialist
headquarters, a large and impressive building
bearing the significant name <i>Maison de Peuple</i>,
the House of the People. The permanent
background of the stage in the assembly hall
of that building is a colossal head of Jesus of
Nazareth, the reverent work of a Belgian Socialist.
This House of the People is the most practical
expression, or perhaps demonstration, of
the co-operative commonwealth in miniature,
which is to be found anywhere in the world.
Starting with a sack of potatoes and a bag of
flour, these wage-workers in ten years erected a
building costing $250,000. Of this sum, which
was loaned by the national bank, they had then
paid $100,000 and had assets worth three times
as much as the balance due on the mortgage,
which they continue to reduce by annual payments.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this four-story semi-circular building, at
one of the principal business centers, ample accomodations
are provided for a great variety of
practical agencies. A café, which paid a profit
of $2,400 in three months, shares the front of
the ground floor with a large co-operative department
store, where dry goods, house furnishings,
clothing, meats, groceries, butter and milk,
hats, hosiery and shoes are sold. A bakery, with
a capacity of 125,000 loaves of bread a week;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>a coal depot, with twenty-nine delivery carts;
a laundry, and a clothing manufactory are
among the business enterprises conducted here.</p>

<p class='c006'>The 19,000 co-operating families receive as
their share of the profits 12 per cent of the money
they pay for bread, 6 per cent of what their
groceries cost them and 5 per cent of the purchase
price of their clothing. Among the protective
features are an employment bureau for
men and women, a pharmacy and a corps of
thirteen physicians rendering free service to all
members of one year’s standing, and a sick benefit
society with 8,000 members. Singing and
ethical classes are maintained for children and
a well-trained orchestra and choral club for
adults. Small halls adequately provide for the
meetings of the trade sections, and a great auditorium,
seating 2,436 persons, rallies the festival
gatherings and supplies room for political mass
meetings.</p>

<p class='c006'>From this national center the procession of
mid August took up its line of march, carrying
banners which took the keynote of their inscriptions
from the following figures emblazoned
everywhere:</p>

<p class='c012'>993,070 have 1 vote;</p>

<p class='c012'>395,866 have 2 votes;</p>

<p class='c012'>704,549 voters, having two, three or four
votes, cast 1,717,871 votes, a majority of
88,523 over those having one vote;</p>

<p class='c012'>One man one vote!</p>

<p class='c006'>In Belgium a man over twenty-five years of
age gets an extra vote if he owns property. He
is granted another vote if he has a university
diploma. He casts a fourth vote if he is over
thirty-five years of age, is the father of a family
and pays taxes on more than a certain amount
of property. The majority of the industrial
population thus have only one vote, while the
rural, well-to-do and richer people outvote each
wage earner by two, three or even four votes.
The rural population thus controls the city industrial
population and the church is charged by
the Socialists with controlling the rural vote.</p>

<p class='c006'>Against this rule of the minority, this great
demonstration of 1911 was a protest. But to the
onlooker from abroad it then seemed to be a
patriotic proclamation of Belgium’s one great
hope of national evolution without revolution.
The primary cause of the movement which has
culminated in the present national strike was the
defeat of the liberal and Socialist coalition in
parliament by a combination of the government
and clerical forces in the elections of 1912. The
Socialist congress summoned to meet the issue
brought to a crisis by that event decided upon a
general strike as a last resort if all other means
of obtaining manhood suffrage failed. But before
resorting to that measure a general suffrage
bill was introduced into parliament by the
Socialists and supported by the liberals. As serious
consideration of it was refused by the clerical
and government authorities, a general strike
was voted on April 14.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whatever the full effect of this national political
strike may be, those who are the keenest
observers concede that the making of history
is in the movement of Belgian labor for one man
one vote suffrage.</p>

<p class='c006'>Certain it is that a movement of the people
capable of maintaining and increasing for so
many years a labor vote in parliament until it
numbers more than one-third of the total must
be reckoned with. If now the tolerance of this
Belgian Socialist Party toward those who honestly
oppose its principles and methods, at this
supreme crisis in its history and the national development,
grows with its strength and equals
its determination, it will improve the greatest
opportunity the Socialist cause has ever had in
the sphere of practical politics to demonstrate
and promote its co-operative commonwealth.</p>

<h3 class='c019'>II.<br> WILLIAM ENGLISH WALLING</h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c022'>If the Belgian strike is a world-event of the
first magnitude for the general public, it has
a still greater significance for the world’s ten
or twenty million Socialists. The two wings of
the Socialist movement are equally interested; the
reformers and conciliators, because the strike
aims at a purely political reform, and involves
co-operation with a part of the capitalists, both
in order to win success now and in order to get
immediate use out of the suffrage after it is won;
the revolutionists and advocates of class struggle
because the strike forces a large loss on many
unwilling employers and gives training for later
and more aggressive strikes for the purpose of
raising wages, cutting down profits, and paving
the way to social revolution.</p>

<p class='c006'>These essential facts are being widely understood.
Take, for example, the following editorial
paragraphs from the influential and progressive,
but by no means radical, <cite>Chicago Tribune</cite>:</p>

<p class='c012'>“For years the thinkers of the movement
in Europe were building up theories about
the ‘political mass strike.’ These theories
have now been put into practice in Belgium
with remarkable precision.</p>

<p class='c012'>“The strike in Belgium is not a precipitated
strike. For months the Socialists of
that country have been making preparations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>for it. They have been collecting
money, storing provisions, and, what is even
more important, educating the workingmen
to their theories, training them to respond
to the strike call like drilled soldiers. It is
not an emotional, not an impulsive strike,
therefore, but a coolly thought out, shrewdly
calculated battle....</p>

<p class='c012'>“As a result of this careful planning and
training by the leaders 400,000 workingmen
responded to Socialist colors with the precision
of a trained army. The strike is both
a battle and military review. The Socialists
now have a clear and adequate view
of their strength and numbers. The issue
involved in this strike, which is uniform
as opposed to plural voting, may be lost.
The strike may even be called off by the
Socialists themselves after a week or so if
the government does not yield by that time.
But the advantages which Socialism has
gained by this census of its army is incalculable.
It knows how much of the Belgian
public is behind it and to what extent. This
time the general strike is used to combat a
single abuse of the government. In the future
the same working masses may be directed
against the present régime as a whole. It
is a strike now. It may be a civil war or
revolution the next time.”</p>

<p class='c006'>But while the capitalistic <cite>Tribune</cite> is so sympathetic
and optimistic, the leading labor union
paper of this country, the <cite>United Mine Workers’
Journal</cite> has been highly sceptical and pessimistic:</p>

<p class='c012'>“The strikers say they are ready and have
the means to hold out six weeks.</p>

<p class='c012'>“What if the other class should elect to
hold out for twelve weeks; that is, if the
strike should become a ‘lock-out?’</p>

<p class='c012'>“There is no doubt but that the class against
whom they are striking, the propertied class,
who hold the unfair political advantage
over them, could store more per member
than the workers.</p>

<p class='c012'>“We wish our brothers every success. Hope
they will obtain what is undoubtedly theirs
by right. But, in our opinion, unless the
strike results in a test of force instead of
passive endurance (and this same is more
than probable) the workers’ needs will drive
them back to their tasks before those who
have been enriched by their labor will consent
to give up the political advantages on
which their economic advantages are based.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Why this remarkable reversal of the opinions
that might have been expected? Why have some
of the richest Liberals in Belgium supported the
strike?</p>

<p class='c006'>The Belgians are striking for a right the
French obtained in 1876—equal suffrage. Yet
who are the chief beneficiaries of the political
democracy of France? The condition of the
laborers is about the same as in Belgium. The
only difference is that in France the industrial
and urban capitalists now hold the balance of
power between the laborers on the one hand and
the reactionary agrarians, landlords and employing
peasants on the other; while in Belgium the
latter classes, which control the Catholic Party,
have a Parliamentary majority over the laborers
and urban middle classes combined. The Belgium
Liberals then have had everything to win
by a strike, which aims at establishing the
French situation in that country. As for the
Socialists, equal suffrage would undoubtedly
have the effect of driving the Liberals and Catholics
together into the same government, as in
Germany, thus making the Socialists <i>the</i> opposition
party. It would also result ultimately in
whatever social and labor reforms the Liberals
might feel it to their interest to grant. But this
is all.</p>

<p class='c006'>This is why thoughtful Socialists the world
over, including several of the Belgian leaders
(Vandervelde, Huysmans, De Brouckère and
Bertrand) have been so dubious about the strike.
They have seen that the burden of the contest will
fall about equally on employers and employes.
But the Liberal employers are playing for a
splendid stake—Belgium; while the Socialists are
playing only for such incidental and secondary
benefits as will accrue to them from Liberal control
of the country. Naturally they have had far
more dread of the costs and risks which the strike
involves.</p>

<p class='c006'>But whether the strike was to be lost or won
it has been clear that it would interest the
world’s millions of Socialists more deeply than
ever in the possibilities and the limitations of
the general strike.</p>

<p class='c006'>All Socialists favor the political general strike,
most Socialists favor the general strike against
war—including the conservatives like Keir Hardie
and Jean Jaurès. The moderate Swedes had
an economic general strike a few years ago and
this form is favored also by the majority of
French and Italian labor unionists. And now
the British unionists are voting on the question
whether they will all quit work each day after
eight hours—which would mean a general lock-out,
or practically a general strike.</p>

<p class='c006'>Whether the Belgians win or lose will not affect
the momentum of the movement. If they
win, general strikes for a few years will take a
predominantly political character, and we shall
see the general political strike resumed in Hungary
within a few months and doubtless declared
in Prussia before many years. If they lose these
British, French and Italian movements toward
economic general strikes will have the field.</p>

<p class='c006'>The historian of the future when writing of
our generation will have to give a central position—perhaps
<i>the</i> central position—to the general
strike.</p>
